,  "description" : "  quest for camelot  is warner bros .  first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disneys cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . the only other recent challenger to their throne was last falls promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production  anastasia ,  but disneys  hercules ,  with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997s best piece of animation . this year , its no contest , as  quest for camelot  is pretty much dead on arrival . even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- thatd be  pocahontas  for those of you keeping score -- isnt nearly as dull as this . the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthurs round table . kayleys only dream is to follow in her fathers footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthurs magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) thats always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthurs side .   quest for camelot  is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if its ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . theres nothing here that differentiates  quest  from something youd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage .  ( compare kayley and garretts run-in with the angry ogre to hercs battle with the hydra . i rest my case . ) even the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . in the end , its a tie -- they all win . that dragons comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . at least fans of the early-90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel  urkel  white and bronson  balki  pinchot sharing the same footage . a few scenes are nicely realized ( though im at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who dont sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults ,  quest for camelot  s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way .

,  "description" : "so ask yourself what  8mm  (  eight millimeter  ) is really all about . is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , theres a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wont necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? im not talking about snuff films , supposed  documentaries  of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . im talking about films like  8mm  and its director , joel schumacher . with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit--  batman & robin ,   a time to kill ,   batman forever ,   the client  --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . is  8mm  something you really want to see ? probably not . the first two-thirds of  8mm  unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . then , as its been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . and just when you think its finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . trust me . there are better ways to waste two hours of your life . nicolas   snake eyes   cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husbands safe documents a young girls murder . welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you dont need any specialized skills or training to do this . welles certainly makes it look easy . and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schraders  hardcore .  occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa .   8mm  doesnt condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . the irony , of course , is that schumacher and  seven  scribe andrew kevin walkers vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . later its the turn of joaquin phoenix ( whos quite good and by far the films most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . all this to get to the familiar yet offensive  revelation  that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . neither super nor standard ,  8mm  is shocking only in its banality .

,  "description" : "thats exactly how long the movie felt to me . there werent even nine laughs in nine months . its a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . its not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , its the fact that grant is annoying . not just adam sandler-annoying , were talking jim carrey-annoying . since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grants head in joan cusacks lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grants pregnant girlfriend she has  a big pussy ,  referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . why a child psychologist ? so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : kid : my dads an asshole . grant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? kid : my dads a _huge_ asshole . more like a hugh asshole , but thats beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . so , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grants equally annoying friends wife is also pregnant . the annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed  arnie the dinosaur  ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . not even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . his is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? thats my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line  now its time to take a look at your volvo ,  another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . nine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . hugh grants sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly wont leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grants nervous smiles . everything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . over 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . but at least they didnt spend 60 bucks for it .

,  "description" : "call it a road trip for the walking wounded . stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that its difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . thats an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . they havent spoken in years , and wouldnt even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it werent for kaisas mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live .  ( only in the movies , right ? ) too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isnt muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasnt fallen very far from the tree . kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . aint they a pair ? unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . by the time they reach the hospital , its time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , theyre also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . this revelation exists purely for its own sake . aberdeen doesnt know where else to go . weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . headeys too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe shed figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . its worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiters captivating signs & wonders . its not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( theyre not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . despite skarsg ? rds solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . theres genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . nossiters film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least its willing to stretch beyond what weve come to expect from traditional drama . aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdans trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martins hollywood mogul pronounces ,  all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies !  even foreign films are taking that advice to heart .

( keep reading ) the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie , the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems . . . plentiful !  ( why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top ? why dont they just cut the mouseketeers rope at the top of the tower , instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging ? why doesnt anybody look a day older , when the sequence says  14 years later  ?  ( at least . . . change your shirt , man ! ) keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a  fun time  , but this flick just didnt cut it for me . it was boring for stretches , the acting was atrocious at times ( the  romantic  scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe ) , there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat ? i will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its  raison-detre  , as the french would say ) , its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film . i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer , but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film . the first comes right at the beginning of the movie , while the other essentially finishes the film off , hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders . the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap . and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this films credits ? hullo ? the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers . deneuve is barely in this movie ! ugh , just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash . now say it together , gang :  all for one , and one for all . . . we vow to stay away from it all ! !  thank me later . wheres joblo coming from ? a knights tale ( 7/10 ) - american outlaws ( 5/10 ) - crouching tiger , hidden dragon ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the replacement killers ( 6/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 ) "

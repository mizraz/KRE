<p class="center xxlargefont boldfont">THE LONE CHIEF;<br>
<span class="smallfont">OR,</span><br>
<span class="xlargefont">The Trappers of the Saskatchewan.</span></p>

<p>The Lone Chief is the noted Omaha “Blackbird,” who takes the

him in hours of awful trial, and awakens our warmest admiration.</p>

<p>His unexpected friends—a band of trappers—become involved
with him in the meshes of a conflict with the fierce Crees of the

<p>The old trapper, Ben Duncan, a second edition of Old Nick

<p>That there are women in the case does not lessen the interest
taken in the Chief’s affairs by the two younger members of Old
Duncan’s party, who, even in that remote region, find that the course

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE RANGER’S RUSE.</span></h2>


<p>A tall, muscular young fellow, dressed in hunter garb,
came silently out of the woods from the north side of the
Kentucky river, about a hundred years ago, and pausing by
the bole of a gigantic beech tree, scanned the opposite shore
with keen, silent attention.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar air of resolute fearless deviltry in the
face of the young hunter, coupled with the piercing, roving
glances of his intensely black eyes, that showed he was no
novice to the trade of hunter and scout. He was in the
midst of the hunting-grounds of Shawnee and Delaware,
miles away from the then infant settlement of Boonesborough;
and he was all alone with his rifle and knife, to take care of
himself.</p>

<p>The look of his face abundantly evinced that he felt quite
equal to the task, and only the acquired caution of his craft
kept him from wading boldly into the river at once.</p>

<p>But as it was, he had learned the lesson of the successful
Indian-slayer by hard experience. Therefore, now, it was
with a long, deep scrutiny that he scanned the opposite banks,
across the first open piece of landscape he had come on in
a day’s travel. On the opposite bank all was still as death,
save for the occasional note of a bird. It was late in May
and the forest was all blinded with its canopy of leaves,
while game was distant and hiding in the coverts.</p>

<p>As the young hunter looked, a black squirrel, shyest of
all its kind, ran out on a limb of a tree on the other side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the river, and stood, whisking its tail and chattering, before
his eyes, above the stream.</p>

<p>“Wal,” muttered the young man, as he stepped boldly
out, “thar kurn’t be much to be skeered on when <em>you’re</em> thar,
my little kuss. Go ahead, Simon.”</p>

<p>Without further ado he descended the bank, deep, brown,
and bare, for some sixty feet, and then ran quickly across a
bed of sand into the shallow stream.</p>

<p>The Kentucky river, in winter a broad and powerful
stream, had dwindled under the summer heats to a rivulet
not more than two hundred feet across, running over a sandy
rocky bed walled in by high banks.</p>

<p>Into this stream waded the hunter, and soon found himself
midway between the banks and up to his armpits in
water. He was obliged to lift up rifle and powder-horn over
his head as he waded along, and every now and then he
would stop to brace himself against the current, and glance
anxiously up and down either side of the river, as if anticipating
the presence of enemies, ready to take him at advantage.</p>

<p>At last the water began to sink below his arms; and slowly
he emerged from the river, strode through the shallows,
and stood on the opposite shore.</p>

<p>“By the holy poker!” he muttered, as he climbed the
further bank, “that ar’s a bad scrape fur to ketch a kuss in.
You’d best git to cover right smartly, Simon, ef you’re the
spy you used to was. <em>Git!</em>”</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, he hurried up the bank into the woods,
and threw himself down under a tree, completely hidden
from sight. With the hunter’s instinct, he lay still as death,
listening intently for sounds. The presence of the squirrel
had assured him of the quiet of things before, or he would
not have ventured where he did. But, the hunter knew too
well that a very few minutes were able to change the whole
current of events around him, and that the chance passing of
a single Indian might render his own situation very perilous.</p>

<p>It was therefore with the keenest attention that he looked
and listened in the woods all round, before going further.</p>

<p>Presently came the sweet pipe of a red-bird from a tree
not far off, and the hunter muttered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right on <em>that</em> side.”</p>

<p>He knew the note, as belonging to one of the most wary
of birds. Then several other birds chirped at intervals, and
he heard the tiny chatter of squirrels all round him.</p>

<p>“Simon, you blamed ornary kuss, I reckon you kin git,”
said the hunter deliberately, and he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so, when he sunk down again as if
shot, for the loud snap of a dry stick sounded plainly in the
air, and it came from the further bank of the river.</p>

<p>“Follered, by the holy poker!” he ejaculated, in a low
tone. “Now, who the Old Scratch kin that be?”</p>

<p>As he spoke he threw himself down behind the tree, and,
bringing all his intelligence to bear on the north bank, which
he had just left, awaited the advance of the stranger.</p>

<p>There was no more noise now. The other, whoever he
was, had evidently been startled by his own carelessness.
Apart from the snapping of that single stick, there was no
further sign of human presence on the north bank.</p>

<p>The man on the south bank lay there watching silently and
eagerly, but saw nothing. The usual noises of the woods
kept on around him, and he could see squirrels moving on the
other side of the river.</p>

<p>There was a small deserted space on either side of him,
and a patch of the same breadth on the opposite side that
showed him that the wild animals were shy of human creatures,
and revealed to him the locality of his enemy.</p>

<p>In those two places all were still, and, as unerringly as if
he had seen the strange hunter, Simon guessed that the latter
had come to the identical tree by which himself had first
scanned the river.</p>

<p>“And by the holy poker, ef that’s so, the kuss kin see my
trail,” he grumbled, half aloud. “Simon, Simon, you orter
be ashamed of yourself fur leavin’ them huff-tracks in the
mud, when ye mout ’a’ jumped from stone to stone.”</p>

<p>Even while he grumbled, his eyes were fixed on the great
beech tree, and the heavy Kentucky rifle he carried was
trained on its bole, while he watched with intense gaze for a
motion of the foe he guessed to be there.</p>

<p>Suddenly he shifted his gaze and aim to a point on one
side of the tree, and fired at something moving there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaping to one side out of the smoke, he distinctly beheld
the splinters of bark fly where his bullet struck, and the next
moment felt the stinging whiz of a bullet, that grazed his
own side, as an answering puff of white smoke came <em>from
the other side of the tree</em>, followed by the sharp crack of a
rifle. The bullet stung him sharply, and he dropped to the
earth, catching a glimpse of the vanishing figure of a man
on the other side of the river, flitting from tree to tree.</p>

<p>“By the holy poker, that’s a right smart kuss, whoever he
is,” muttered Simon, ruefully, as he rubbed his side, “Who’d
’a’ thunk he’d ’a’ fooled me as quick as that, and with sich an
old trick. By the holy poker, Simon, you’d better go and
soak your head ef you ain’t smarter than that kuss. But,
I’ll get even with him. Darn me ef he shall fool me ag’in
like that. No, sir. Mister stranger, be you white or red,
runnygade or Shawnee, I’ll hev your skulp fur that ar’ shot,
or my name ain’t Simon Kenton.”</p>

<p>And the renowned ranger darted from tree to tree on his
passage up the river, following the shadowy form of his
antagonist, as he caught occasional glimpses of it, and both
tending toward a spot a mile further up the stream, where a
wooded island reduced the danger of crossing to a less
degree.</p>

<p>The two enemies raced for that island, loading as they ran.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE ISLAND.</span></h2>


<p>In ten minutes more, Kenton reached a bend of the river,
in the midst of which stood the little wooded island at which
he thought his foe would be likely to try to cross. At that
turn he made a discovery which caused him to stop with a
gratified chuckle.</p>

<p>He was on the inside of the curve, and the position of the
island was such that he commanded the whole of the further
side. No human being could cross there by daylight without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
being seen by an observer at the center of the
curve.</p>

<p>Besides this, he could see the further bank of the river
beyond for nearly two miles, and his enemy would be
obliged to make a large <em>detour</em> if he expected to cross at all.
That he wished to cross, the hunter felt certain, but he had
totally gone out of sight now, and the opposite shore looked
as silent and deserted as when Kenton first entered the
river.</p>

<p>“By the holy poker, I’ve got ye, middlin’ sure,” muttered
the ranger, gleefully. “Ef ye try to move off, I’m arter ye,
like a painter arter a young shoat. Ef ye stay thar, durn
me ef I kurn’t wait as long as you kin. So now.”</p>

<p>He sheltered himself under a great spreading tree and lay
there watching the opposite shore. He knew well enough
that his enemy had not gone thence. The practiced senses of
the hunter would have detected a moving figure, however it
tried to shelter itself among the trees; and moreover, <em>the
scouts of nature</em>, the free wild creatures of the forest, served
by their actions to indicate the whereabouts of each foe to
the other, well used as both were to reading the open book
of nature.</p>

<p>From various indications, Kenton came to the conclusion
that his enemy was lying down behind the gnarled roots of
a huge old oak at the edge of the bank opposite the end of
the island; and Kenton was right.</p>

<p>There behind that tree lay his wily foe, watching the very
tree at which Simon was posted. As far as woodcraft went,
it was diamond cut diamond with the two.</p>

<p>Presently Simon chuckled to himself, as a thought struck
him.</p>

<p>“Now ef that ar’s a Shawnee hunter, mebbe I kin fool
him yit. He don’t know who the Old Scratch I am, and ef I
give a Shawnee signal mebbe he’ll show.”</p>

<p>The hunter rose to his feet behind the tree, and shouted
the Shawnee war-cry with the full force of his lungs.</p>

<p>It was instantly answered from the other side of the river,
by the peculiar whoop of the Miamis.</p>

<p>In the same instant Simon stuck his cap on the end of his
rifle and protruded it from behind his tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had he done so when a bullet whizzed through the
cap, with an accuracy of aim that surprised even him.</p>

<p>The ranger stepped from behind the tree, and leveled his
rifle at the white puff of smoke on the other side of the river.
He saw the form of a man vanish as he fired, and was greeted
with a derisive whoop of scorn.</p>

<p>Kenton sunk back to his old position to reload, muttering:
“By the holy poker, mister, thur bean’t no discount on you
fur a warrior. Kurn’t fool that kuss. He must ’a’ seen the
cap. That skulp’s wuth hav’in’. Reckon it must be old
Blackfish or Otter Lifter hisself. No common brave c’u’d be
as smart as that.”</p>

<p>It certainly seemed as if matters were at a dead lock. Two
shots had been fired by Simon Kenton, the best marksman of
the border, after Boone, and each had brought nothing but a
return as close as his own.</p>

<p>Reckless as the nature of the ranger was, he began to think
that he couldn’t afford to try any more risks with such a foe.
The chances were too evenly balanced. He threw himself
down in a place whence he could command a good view of
the north bank, and determined to wait. He was well aware
that night would surely bring things to a crisis and end the suspense.
For darkness he determined to wait, resolved not to
give his foe another chance.</p>

<p>For at least an hour all was profoundly still, and not a motion
on either bank betrayed the presence of the two wily
antagonists. Then Simon Kenton started violently and muttered
to himself:</p>

<p>“By the holy poker, what’s that?”</p>

<p>There was a distinct rustling of trees and bushes on the
little island in the river.</p>

<p>“Is that kuss the devil himself?” queried Simon, wonderingly.
“How in the Old Scratch did he get <em>thar</em>?”</p>

<p>The sound of rustling increased on the island, and at last
the ranger saw a bush move.</p>

<p>Crack went his rifle on the instant.</p>

<p>It was blended with a report from the opposite side of the
river, and Kenton saw the white smoke curl up from the very
place whence his foe had not stirred.</p>

<p>But where went <em>that</em> bullet?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The question was answered ere asked.</p>

<p>Both foemen had arrived at the island, and a shower of
splintered bark and twigs flew up from the midst of the bush
at which both marksmen had aimed!</p>

<p>A loud shriek, in the unmistakable tones of <em>a woman</em>, rose
from the island, and the rustling of bushes became violent, as
some one fell back into cover.</p>

<p>Then all was still again.</p>

<p>Simon rubbed his eyes. For a moment he was so bewildered
that he forgot to reload his rifle.</p>

<p>“By the holy poker, it’s a gal on the island, and we must
’a’ nigh shot her!” he ejaculated, aloud. “Wal, ef this don’t
beat cockfightin’, I’m durned. So now!”</p>

<p>The words seemed to relieve him in some way, for the
hunter-instinct returned, and he proceeded to reload his rifle.</p>

<p>But as he loaded, he muttered:</p>

<p>“Simon, Simon, go home and soak your head for a durned
fool! Three shots fired, and nary hit. What would Boone
say ef he knowed it. By the holy poker, I’d as soon face
Old Scratch as face the cunnel arter this bout, ef I don’t git
that kuss’s sculp. So now.”</p>

<p>He rammed home the bullet with a vicious thump as he
said this, and resumed his weary watch. The situation had
become more complicated.</p>

<p>A woman was on that island, a white woman, or she would
<a id="Ref_15"></a>not have shrieked. The squaw is well-nigh as stoical in danger
as her warrior husband.</p>

<p>On the other side the river was a merciless savage, who
would not hesitate to scalp her if he got a chance. In a moment
the native chivalry of the Kentuckian was up in arms,
and his face assumed an expression of grim ferocity, such as
few men would have cared to face, as he scanned the opposite
shore, muttering, as he clenched his rifle:</p>

<p>“Now may I never fire a shot ag’in as long as I live, ef I
let you git your claws on that gal, Mister Stranger. Sink or
swim I’m a-goin’ fur her jest as soon as it’s dark, an’ ef thar
ain’t some clawin’ o’ wool on that there island about the time
we git there, wallop me for a skunk. So now.”</p>

<p>He remained at his post, watching his enemy’s tree with a
sleepless vigilance and ferocity, that told how much in earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he was. Hour after hour passed; the sun sunk down to the
west and fell behind the curtain of forest; the dark shadows
sloped weirdly across the tree-trunks; the deer flitted about
through the aisles of the woods, unconscious of the two statue-like
figures that lay on the ground, each watching his enemy’s
lair like a lurking tiger; squirrel and bird, cicada and
snake, fox and rabbit, wandered about the vicinity perfectly
undisturbed; for the two men lay so still that the animals
had come to the conclusion they must be dead. Then at last
the twilight faded into darkness, and the river and banks became
indistinct. Suddenly Kenton leaped to his feet and
dashed through the cover to a narrow place opposite the island.
He used no caution, for now the island sheltered him
from view entirely. But, as he dashed into the water, he
heard his enemy thunder along on the opposite bank, and
knew that it would be a race for the island.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE MEETING.</span></h2>


<p>The sturdy ranger uttered a fierce war-whoop, and struggled
through the deep water toward the island.</p>

<p>At the place where he was, the stream was only some
twenty feet broad, <em>but</em>, it was swimming deep and quite
rapid.</p>

<p>On the other side it was five times as broad, but much
more shallow, so that his opponent would have that advantage
over him. Still, being on the arc of a circle, the distance
to be traversed was much greater, and reduced the chances
to evenness.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton leaped into the current, rifle in hand, and
sunk over his head in a moment, striking out for the opposite
shore with desperate energy. Twice the strong current carried
him down, and twice he touched a rock and shoved
against it so vigorously that he nearly reached the opposite
shore. Each time, the weight of his long rifle ducked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
head and nearly strangled him, while the struggle became
fiercer than ever.</p>

<p>At last, just as he was passing the end of the island, he
caught a friendly bough and dragged himself up to shore
with dripping weapons, just as he caught sight of the dark
figure of his enemy about the middle of the stream in the
shallows, but up to his waist in water.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton uttered the Shawnee war-whoop once more
and tore through the brushwood to intercept his foe.</p>

<p>“Now, ye ornary kuss, I’ve got ye, by the holy poker!” he
growled savagely, as he stood on the bank above, and leveled
his rifle at the other.</p>

<p><em>Click! fizz! sput!</em></p>

<p>The soaked powder missed fire, and Kenton uttered a savage
growl as he flung the heavy rifle with all his force at
his opponent, who was just raising his own weapon to fire
back.</p>

<p>The ranger’s rifle hit the other as it went off, with such
violence, that the man in the water staggered, slipped in the
current, and fell back splashing and going under.</p>

<p>“Now we’re even, durn your painted hide!” yelled the
irate Kenton, as he made one tremendous bound off the
high bank into the water, drawing his knife as he leaped.</p>

<p>In another moment two strong men were grappling in water
nearly up to their armpits, each having a knife in his
right hand, and grasping his antagonist’s wrist with his left.</p>

<p>They tripped and stumbled, wrestled and struggled in grim
silence, both being equally matched in strength and agility,
and fighting with the deadliest ferocity. Twice they went
under water, and stumbled up without relaxing their gripe,
and still neither had gained the least advantage.</p>

<p>At last, almost at the same moment, Kenton and his foe
wrenched away from each other to regain breath, and stood
panting and glaring at each other for several seconds at about
six feet apart.</p>

<p>The Kentuckian was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“You’re a tough cuss, stranger, I don’t deny it; but you
and me’s got to settle this hyar business afore we go home,
and by the holy poker, you kurn’t sculp <em>that</em> gal, ef you’re
Blackfish hisself. So now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger had been entirely silent so far in the struggle.
As Kenton finished, he put out one hand and said:</p>

<p>“<em>Simon, is that you? Well, this</em> <span class="smcap">is</span> <em>a good story</em>.”</p>

<p>The voice of the stranger was deep and powerful; he spoke
better English than Kenton, and the latter seemed to recognize
the tones in a moment.</p>

<p>The ranger sprung back in the water, with a cry of wonder,
and shouted out:</p>

<p>“Gee-Christopher-cricket-and-blue-blazes! Wal, ef we arn’t
be’n a couple of durndest jack-mules this side of ole Virginny.
By the holy poker, <em>it’s Cunnel Boone</em>!”</p>

<p>Daniel Boone himself indulged in a short laugh, instantly
checked, as he quietly said:</p>

<p>“And I took you for a Shawnee scout, Kenton, and
thought you wanted to scalp the girl on the island. Well,
well.”</p>

<p>Not another word passed between the two famous hunters,
so strangely met, for some time. They returned their knives
in silence, groped about in the water with their moccasined
feet, and discovered their rifles, with which they slowly
landed on the island, both buried in curious cogitations.</p>

<p>They ascended the bank together and entered the thick
cover of bushes before either of them spoke, and then Kenton,
in a sort of sheepish tone, said:</p>

<p>“’Twon’t do to tell this story too permiskus, cunnel, I
reckon. I’m clean ashamed o’ myself fur not pluggin’ ye,
when ye give me such a chance. I war a-sayin’ to myself,
what would cunnel say ef he knowed I’d made sich a show o’
myself to a Injun varmint, leave alone a white man, and <em>sich</em>
a white man as you, cunnel.”</p>

<p>Boone again uttered one of his low laughs.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Simon, I was thinking that <em>I</em> was
the man to feel ashamed. You never saw <em>me</em>, and you put
two holes into my old cap, for all that. I <em>saw</em> you, and
missed you. Simon, I thank God for my erring hand.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence, both hunters being busily employed
in drawing the charges from their wet rifles, and
wiping the same. Then Kenton spoke, with a curious mingling
of pride and regret in his voice, hesitating in a manner
not usual with the reckless borderer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then ye don’t think I did so bad arter all, cunnel. I
swow I feel amazin’ glad I didn’t hit yer, but still—ye don’t
think I acted like a greeny—eh, cunnel?”</p>

<p>“You did what no other woodman in Kentucky could do,
Simon. You fooled Daniel Boone,” said the elder hunter, in
a grave tone. “I didn’t believe it lay in ye, and I don’t
want to meet ye again in such a fashion. But one thing we
forget. There’s a white woman on this island, and we have
to find her; and, besides that, we haven’t a dry thread till
we light a fire. Take one side the island, and I’ll take the
other, and hunt till we find her.”</p>

<p>The young ranger raised his hand to his cap in a military
salute, as he turned away.</p>

<p>“All right, cunnel. We’ll git her.”</p>

<p>The two hunters moved off on either side of the island in
a circuit, which speedily brought them face to face at the upper
end, for there was not more than an acre of ground embraced
in its limits.</p>

<p>Neither of them had come across any traces of a human
being.</p>

<p>Again they turned and searched in the opposite direction,
moving cautiously and stopping frequently to listen for the
rustle of bushes. At last it became plain that the former occupant
of the island, whoever it might be, had decamped in
some manner, probably during the noise and confusion of their
struggle in the river. At all events, she was not to be found,
and the two hunters gave up the search in their second
round.</p>

<p>It was altogether too dark to trail, and both concluded to
wait till morning for the purpose. Meantime a fire was
kindled in the midst of a dense thicket in the middle of the
island, screened on all sides by brushwood, and made of dry
punk gathered from a rotten fallen tree. Then, by the side
of the glowing embers, the wearied hunters dried clothes and
arms, cleaned their guns, and consulted on their future movements,
after detailing to each other the results of their separate
scouts through the Shawnee hunting-grounds, up to the
time when they had so unexpectedly met on the banks of the
Kentucky.</p>

<p>It took but a little time to exchange news, and then both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
composed themselves to slumber, with their feet to the fire,
and slept till the first streaks of dawn appeared in the eastern
sky.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">RUBY ROLAND.</span></h2>


<p>Simon Kenton was the first to wake in the morning. Instead
of experiencing the usual feeling of chilliness which assails
the camper-out in the early hours by a dying fire, he was
sensible of a glowing and comfortable warmth at his feet, and
his eyes opened on the leaping white flames of a pleasant
fire, the brands crackling merrily, as if lately put on.</p>

<p>“By the holy poker, cunnel,” quoth the borderer, rubbing
his eyes and stretching, “you’re ahead of me this hyar mornin’.
Wal, let’s get up and make tracks.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he yawned portentously, and sat up, only to
fall back the next moment with a loud exclamation of:</p>

<p>“Who in the Old Scratch <em>be</em> you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Boone lay fast asleep opposite, and by the fire, between
them, sat a <em>young girl</em>, looking intently at Kenton.</p>

<p>“I am Ruby Roland,” said one of the sweetest voices he
had ever heard; and the girl smiled in his face, fearlessly.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton slowly rose up to a sitting posture and stared
at the new-comer in utter amazement, just as Boone also
awoke, and rolling half over, fixed his steady gaze on the
girl, but without exhibiting the surprise displayed by Kenton.</p>

<p>The girl was a little creature of some seventeen summers,
with a dark, foreign-looking face, very pretty, lighted with
black eyes, and set off with black hair, arranged in two long
plaits. She was attired in the costume of an Indian chief’s
daughter, of the richest materials in use among the Shawnees,
and carried with her a bow and arrows.</p>

<p>First Simon drew in his feet, and sat up in a more polite
position, then Daniel Boone slowly rose and sat looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the strange maiden; and then a deep silence fell on all three,
which was first broken by the girl who called herself Ruby
Roland.</p>

<p>“You two are Simon Kenton and Colonel Boone, are you
not?” she asked, in her musical voice, slightly accented with
a French intonation.</p>

<p>Boone himself answered her with great respect:</p>

<p>“We are, Miss. I am Colonel Daniel Boone, and this is
Captain Simon Kenton.”</p>

<p>The Kentucky borderers were always remarkably tenacious
of their military titles, and very proud of them. In reality
they represented deeds requiring courage and conduct of a
kind such as few regular soldiers could have boasted of.</p>

<p>Ruby Roland smiled graciously on the two Kentuckians.</p>

<p>“I suppose, then, you will not be afraid to run into danger
on my account, will you? I warn you that a deadly peril
is round us all three, which you can only escape by leaving
me to face it alone. Will you do that?”</p>

<p>“Simon Kenton will not, madam; I will answer for that,”
said the quiet voice of Boone.</p>

<p>“And Cunnel Boone ’ll let the red varmints chaw him up
ter fiddle-strings, afore he deserts a lady. I’ll go a house and
farm on that. So now,” was Kenton’s characteristic reply.</p>

<p>Ruby smiled at them both as she said:</p>

<p>“I knew I was not wrong. You have heard of Tabac, the
Grand Door of the Wabash. I am his daughter.”</p>

<p>Kenton looked more and more astonished. He scratched
his head in a dubious manner, and observed:</p>

<p>“Then, by the holy poker, Miss, all I kin say is that the
Grand Door opens into a very pretty place; but—”</p>

<p>Ruby smiled as he hesitated.</p>

<p>“But you wonder how I come to talk English so well, and
how I come here; is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Wal, Miss, I ain’t denyin’ that same,” said Kenton,
frankly.</p>

<p>“I will tell you, then. The Grand Door is not my own
father. No, alas! <em>he</em> died when I was a baby. But, I have
been adopted by the chief since then, and my mother reigned
over all the tribes of the Wabash till her death, last year. It
was only six weeks ago when I escaped from the Indian town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
by St. Vincent’s, and came here. Gentlemen, I want to see
Colonel George Rogers Clark.”</p>

<p>Both the scouts uttered an involuntary exclamation of
wonder, the first that had escaped the lips of Boone.</p>

<p>“Colonel Clark is at Harrodsburg, Miss,” said the elder
hunter, gravely; “and we shall find it difficult to penetrate
there, for Blackfish, the Shawnee chief, is round it with his
band.”</p>

<p>Ruby Roland smiled with some little appearance of scorn.</p>

<p>“My father was a French officer, and I am the adopted
child of the first war-chief of the West,” she said. “I suppose
you think you could get into Harrodsburg, do you not?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, Miss,” said Boone, quietly.</p>

<p>“Very well; then I will go with you,” said this little fragile-looking
girl, with equal calmness. “You are both good
warriors and scouts, and yet I fooled you both last night.”</p>

<p>“What! was it you, then, as was on this hyar island?”
asked Kenton, in amazement. “Why, whar in the Old Scratch
did ye hide, Miss, ef it ain’t axin’ too much?”</p>

<p>Ruby laughed, and pointed to a great tree that overhung
the camp-fire itself.</p>

<p>“Up there in a hollow, and heard every word you said.
Had you been Shawnees, as you made me think by your
whoops, both would have been dead long ere this. I made
up this fire half an hour ago, and neither of you waked.”</p>

<p>Boone and Kenton looked at each other in silence for several
minutes. The practiced woodmen had been outwitted
by this quiet, modest little girl, and both instinctively felt that
she was no common personage.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone rose to his feet and shook himself, then
looked to the priming of his rifle and examined his weapons
before he spoke. At last he said:</p>

<p>“I am at your orders, Miss. What do you wish us to
do?”</p>

<p>“I am very hungry,” said the girl, simply. “I want
something to eat first. The Shawnees are on my trail, and
I must get to Harrodsburg in some way. I have no rifle,
and I am too weak to shoot well with the bow. I want you
to take me to see Colonel Clark.”</p>

<p>Boone made a sign to Kenton, and the latter disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
among the bushes on the shallow side of the river. As soon
as he was gone, the veteran hunter asked:</p>

<p>“How do you know the Shawnees are on your trail,
Miss?”</p>

<p>“I saw them, only yesterday morning,” she answered. “I
threw them out by floating down the river on a log, and they
are by this time ranging up and down the river to find me.”</p>

<p>Boone frowned thoughtfully and remained silent for some
minutes, when he asked:</p>

<p>“How far off did you leave them, do you think?”</p>

<p>“About thirty-five miles up the stream,” was the quiet
reply.</p>

<p>The old hunter looked with grave admiration at the girl.</p>

<p>“You are a brave girl!” he said. “I have known warriors
not half as brave and skillful. Simon and I did not find
a single sign all of yesterday, and we were on different tracks
too. Do you think they will follow you close?”</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> it,” said Ruby, quietly. “They will follow me
to kill me, till I am safe in Harrodsburg!”</p>

<p>Another man might have asked “why.” Boone had no
idle curiosity; he judged unerringly that the girl was telling
the truth, and wished for no reasons. She gave them herself
a moment later.</p>

<p>“They know my errand to Colonel Clark, and Governor
Hamilton has sent them after me,” she said, meaningly.</p>

<p>Then Boone knew all. The great chief of the Wabash
tribes had doubtless sent his daughter to open negotiations
with the Americans, and the English Governor at Detroit had
got wind of it in some manner, and was resolved to intercept
the fair messenger; for the Revolutionary War was at its
hight, and the British were reckless in subsidizing savages.</p>

<p>As he thought over the atrocious scheme, the old hunter’s
lips compressed themselves into an iron line, and he growled:</p>

<p>“If the dogs cross <em>my</em> path to Harrodsburg, they must look
to themselves. You shall go there safe, Miss.”</p>

<p>The report of a rifle a short way off, was followed by the
cheery shout of Kenton, “A fat buck, and no Injun sign yet.”</p>

<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE JOURNEY.</span></h2>


<p>Half an hour after, three persons rose from a full meal of
broiled venison, comforted and refreshed, and little Ruby
Roland asked:</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, which way?”</p>

<p>“Straight across that thar stream,” said Kenton, pointing
to the deep but narrow channel which separated them from
the south bank. “I’ve been lookin’ fur a place to cross dry-shod,
and thur ain’t but two ways: uther to swim, or to make
a ring-tailed squealer of a jump, which we mout do, but the
lady kurn’t.”</p>

<p>“I will show you a better way than that,” said Ruby,
smiling, “if you will follow me.”</p>

<p>She led them to the south side of the island, where the
swift current had undermined the bank, till it overhung considerably.
At this point the stream was not over twenty
feet wide, and a clump of young chestnut trees overhanging
the water, almost met with their foliage the boughs of a water-elm
on the other bank.</p>

<p>The girl threw her bow and quiver to her back, swung
herself up one of the young trees like a monkey, and immediately
her weight caused it to bend down and touch the
boughs of the elm-tree.</p>

<p>Light as a mountain-cat, she walked along the swaying
perch, caught hold of a long, slender bough of the elm, and
swung safely on her feet on the south bank of the river.</p>

<p>“Well done, by the holy poker!” said Kenton, admiringly.
“Ef I’d ’a’ thunk of that last night, whar would you ha’
be’n, cunnel? No miss fire, then.”</p>

<p>And the reckless borderer crossed the stream, followed by
his companion, both laughing at the recollection of the ludicrous
mistake of the night before.</p>

<p>Arrived on the other side, both became grave and professional
at once; and the girl Ruby, who had hitherto taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the lead, remained subject to the further direction of her protectors.</p>

<p>“Now, Simon,” said the elder scout, “there are no sign
about here yet, but that doesn’t say there won’t be before long.
We’ve a good day’s tramp to Harrodsburg, and, tew chances
to one, the Shawnees will take a short cut and lie in wait for
us at the town, leaving a small party to follow the lady’s
trail. It’s a chance if they hit upon ours. So you take the
right hand, I’ll take the left, and Miss, here, shall have the
middle. Forward.”</p>

<p>Without another word the three set out on their perilous
tramp through the silent woods, at a long distance from each
other, stealing like shadows among the trees, and glancing
from side to side as they went, suspicious of every rustling
leaf.</p>

<p>Boone was at least a hundred yards to the left and in front,
very rarely visible at all, but all eyes and ears in the direction
he was guarding, the quarter from which he himself thought
the danger most imminent.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton was at an equal distance from Ruby on the
other side, and never allowed a glimpse of himself, the only
announcement of his presence being the occasional whistle
of a robin from the leafy covert.</p>

<p>Little Ruby, in the center, held her own course fearlessly,
flitting from tree to tree, and always peering ahead from behind
every trunk, to see that the coast was clear, before flitting
to another. As noiseless as a startled bird, she passed
through the dense forest toward Harrodsburg, without a sounding
footfall, and many a time her two companions would
have thought she had disappeared, but for the answering signals
which she sent back to Kenton, whenever he was doubtful.</p>

<p>Instead of finding the little girl an incumbrance, both hunters
were compelled to admit that her Indian education had
made her a more skillful hider than they.</p>

<p>Thus the three companions pressed through the silent forest
in a south-westerly direction, cutting across the bend of
the stream which separated them from Harrodsburg. They
had only about twenty-five miles to go in a direct line, but in
the woods, and among wily foes like the red-men, such a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
took double the time to traverse that it would on a high-road
in a quiet country. Every half-hour they called a halt,
while the two scouts went on a circuit on either hand, to look
for sign of enemies in pursuit.</p>

<p>For a long time nothing was found. The sun climbed up
overhead, and darted his flaming arrows through the leaves,
the birds ceased to sing, and only the sleepy whirr of the cicada
recurred at intervals to make the silence deeper. Far
away in the woods they could hear the occasional mournful
<em>boom boom</em> of the wood dove, but the squirrels and deer were
all silent and hidden away.</p>

<p>At noon Boone uttered the cry of the wood dove three
times in succession, as a signal to close, and the three friends
met together under a great tree.</p>

<p>“The enemy have passed ahead toward Harrodsburg,” said
the hunter, in a low tone. “I have just come on a trail not
more than three hours old, off to the left. They have twenty
warriors with them, and have gone to join Blackfish and his
band at Harrodsburg.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose doing, then?” asked little Ruby,
quietly.</p>

<p>Boone looked at her several minutes before answering.</p>

<p>“You tell me these men are after you, Miss. Well, nothing
is surer than that we can’t get into the fort by daylight.
We are only seven miles from Harrodsburg now, and if we
run too fast, we shall only fall into a well-prepared ambush.”</p>

<p>“Shall we wait here, then?” she asked, glancing round her
with a quick catch of her breath.</p>

<p>“Not by a jugfull,” said bluff Kenton, interrupting. “See
hyar, cunnel, ef you’ve come acrost a trail ahead, I’ve found
<em>’nuther</em>. Them ornery cusses is <em>arter us</em>; and ef we wait
hyar, we’ll hev to fight afore we’re two hours older. So now.”</p>

<p>Boone looked keenly at his friend.</p>

<p>“How do you know, Simon?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I heern ’em,” said Kenton, laconically.</p>

<p>“Heard what?—shots, yells? I heard nothing.”</p>

<p>And the great hunter looked doubtfully at Kenton, for he
had never yet met his own match for keenness of senses.</p>

<p>Kenton held up his hand for them to listen. A moment
after the faint crack of a rifle echoed far away in the rear.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">DANGER ALL ROUND.</span></h2>


<p>Boone looked grave, Ruby turned a shade paler, and Kenton
smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Ye see, cunnel,” said the scout, “I’ve b’en suspicioning
them cusses mout be arter us all the while, and I’ve b’en
kinder on the watch to the rear. Thar’s a party of the imps
arter the little gal, and they’ve got good trackers. Guess
they’ve b’en huntin’ up and down stream arter her trail, and
got to the island at last. Ef they have, they know the hull
thing now, and they’re comin’ arter us hellaty-clip. ’Tain’t
so middlin’ difficult to pick up our trail, ye know, and what
with them behind, and them in front, we’ll hev a right smart
chance of trouble to flax ’em all, and git into the fort to-night.”</p>

<p>“That shot was not three miles off,” said Ruby, suddenly.
“What do you think it was, Mr. Kenton?”</p>

<p>“That? Oh, that was a signal from the cuss as found our
trail,” said Kenton, carelessly. “It’s middlin’ likely thur
spread out all over the woods huntin’ your trail, Miss; and
that shot ’ll call ’em in.”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said the girl, quietly. “Well, then, gentlemen,
why shouldn’t we cross the trail of the party ahead,
make a circuit, and come into the town on the other side?
They won’t watch that so closely.”</p>

<p>Boone, who had been leaning thoughtfully on his rifle all
this time, now raised his head.</p>

<p>“Little gal,” he said, gravely, “it’s our only chance. But
are you able to take the tramp? ’Twill be a tough one.”</p>

<p>“I am a chief’s daughter,” said the girl, proudly. “Try
me, and see.”</p>

<p>Kenton was about to speak, when Boone checked him with
a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>“Left wheel,” he said, in military fashion, “and follow
your leader.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke he threw his rifle to his shoulder, and started
off at a slow trot of some seven miles an hour into the depths
of the woods, followed, without a word, by the others at long
intervals. Kenton remained behind to bring up the rear,
and away they went into the woods. In a few minutes they
crossed the trail of which Boone had spoken, and Kenton
stopped to examine it carefully. As the elder hunter had said,
it led straight to Harrodsburg, and they crossed it at right-angles,
plunging deep into the woods toward the south, where, at
least, they were certain the country was comparatively free
of enemies.</p>

<p>For at least half an hour they continued their course to
the south, and then Boone turned again, sharp to the west,
and proceeded in the direction of Harrodsburg without more
ado. Kenton remained at least a quarter of a mile nearer
the march of their suspected foes, and chuckled with satisfaction
as he came across several bear and deer-tracks.</p>

<p>The tracks were recent and very regular, unanswerable evidence
to the keen hunter that the animals had been undisturbed
that morning.</p>

<p>When Boone turned, Ruby and Kenton turned likewise, so
that the former Indian file became, once more, a skirmish-line
of three people, stretching over a space a quarter of a mile
wide.</p>

<p>Again they glided cautiously but swiftly along, on the way
to Harrodsburg, the post of honor, nearest the foe, belonging
to Kenton.</p>

<p>The sun was long past the meridian, and sunk rapidly as
they pressed along, till at last his level rays pierced through
the covert of the forest, and announced that the king of day
was about to take his departure.</p>

<p>By that time they judged that they must be nearly abreast
of Harrodsburg, but, so still was the forest, that they could
not tell its position with any certainty.</p>

<p>This very stillness, however, supplied them with one piece
of information which they needed.</p>

<p>It told them they were nearing their enemies.</p>

<p>The birds had ceased to sing, and not a living creature of
the usual denizens of the forest made its appearance on their
right flank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>They knew that the Indians must be there.</p>

<p>Just as the sun set, they heard the reports of several rifles,
a little way off on their right front, and Kenton, immediately
after, sheered off to the left, and came near to Ruby and
Boone.</p>

<p>The three, as if by a common impulse, turned their course
once more to the south, and had the satisfaction of hearing a
brisk fire of rifles beginning, which revealed to them the only
thing they wanted to know, the position of the fort of Harrodsburg.</p>

<p>As they went on and the shots became more distant, Kenton
and Boone closed in on Ruby, so that all three were
within whispering distance, and Kenton panted out:</p>

<p>“Thur havin’ a little muss thar, cunnel. Bully for us!”</p>

<p>Boone made no answer, but kept on his course till they
had left the sounds of conflict far to the rear, when he turned
sharp to the north, motioning the rest to keep behind
him.</p>

<p>Now at last the twilight began to fade.</p>

<p>As the twilight faded, the sounds of conflict grew less
and less frequent. Only an occasional rifle-shot rung out at
intervals; but every one came closer and closer as they advanced.</p>

<p>At last it was dark.</p>

<p>Then the veteran borderer stopped and allowed his two
companions to come up alongside of him, when a short whispered
conversation took place.</p>

<p>So cautious were all of being overheard that they were
obliged to put their lips to each other’s ears to tell and hear,
and the sharpest scout might have lain twenty feet off without
hearing a sound.</p>

<p>“We are close to the imps,” said Boone; “and the fort
gate lies right in front of us. We must keep close together
now.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they know we are around?” said Ruby.</p>

<p>“The Indians must,” said the borderer. “The only trouble
is that the people inside don’t.”</p>

<p>“Ef they’ll fire a few more shots,” said Kenton, “I’ll be
bound to go through safe.”</p>

<p>“They won’t do it,” whispered Boone, in answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken, when, as if to give the lie to his
words, the flash of a rifle came from the black woods toward
the fort, not a hundred yards off.</p>

<p>It was immediately answered by a line of flashes some
distance further on, and the crackling reports of the rifles
were followed by the spiteful <em>plug, plug, plug</em>, of several bullets
slapping into the ground and tree-trunks round them, in
very unpleasant proximity.</p>

<p>“That feller war some young brave on his fust war-path,
cunnel,” whispered Kenton, delightedly, “Ef I don’t flax
him, call me a skunk.”</p>

<p>“Now we know where the fort is, thanks to him,” was
the answer. “There must be a big crowd, Simon, when they
let the youngsters stand picket.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to fotch that feller’s skulp, by the holy poker,”
muttered Kenton. “Ef so be he’s alone thar, we kin creep
through the gap.”</p>

<p>“Be careful, Simon,” replied Boone, cautiously. “Remember
we’re not alone, and the lady can’t run like we
can.”</p>

<p>“All right, cunnel,” said the borderer; and as he spoke he
glided away on his belly like a snake toward the point from
whence the flash had proceeded.</p>

<p>It needed very small indications to point out to these
astute frontiersmen the position of affairs round them. As
well as if he had been at the side of the Indian chief, Kenton
knew that a circle of savages was lying round the fort,
some near, some far, according to the cover. He felt certain
that the Shawnees on Ruby’s trail had arrived long before
and that the Indian besiegers were watching for his arrival.
Their dead silence argued that.</p>

<p>The warrior who had just fired was probably young, and
ambitious of slaying a “Big-Knife.” What he had seen to
fire at was uncertain, but Kenton knew that some cunning
old hand would very soon be down upon his post to scold
him for his carelessness.</p>

<p>It was therefore with senses morbidly alive to external
objects that the borderer crept noiselessly toward the foe.</p>

<p>He took care to feel every place with his hand before he
dared to trust his weight upon it, and in this way it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fully twenty minutes ere he had traversed the hundred yards
that separated him from the Indian line.</p>

<p>At last he judged himself there, and then he lay quite still
and listened intently.</p>

<p>Presently, just as he had anticipated, there was a faint
rustle of dry grass on his right, as if some one were coming
cautiously toward him. He turned his head sharply and
caught the outline of a figure on all fours not twenty feet off,
by the bole of a tree.</p>

<p>The figure was stationary, and presently the low hoot of
an owl resounded from it. The hoot was answered from
the right and left, and the borderer found that he was in the
very midst of his foes.</p>

<p>The creeping Indian moved on a little, and a second figure
rose to meet it, about ten feet in front of Kenton.</p>

<p>It was the figure of the imprudent youngster.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">ON THE LINE.</span></h2>


<p>The two Indians sat down side by side, and proceeded to
hold a short conversation in low tones, the scout seeing every
motion. The outline of one of them was that of an old chief,
for Kenton could distinguish the eagle-feathers, only worn by
chiefs.</p>

<p>This warrior seemed to be gravely lecturing his heedless
companion on his folly in firing, and the young one seemed
to be excusing himself, although Kenton did not fully understand
their words.</p>

<p>The conversation did not last long, for the old chief finally
stole away to the left along the line, as if on a tour of inspection,
and, covered by his rustling, for he moved carelessly, the
borderer crept forward.</p>

<p>It was evident that the old chief, astute as he was, did not
suspect that his enemies were anywhere in the immediate vicinity,
or he would not have made so much noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>He was simply going “grand rounds,” to keep his sentries
on the alert for a possible contingency.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton, leaving his rifle at about four feet from his
enemy, drew his knife, and prepared to spring on the young
Indian, who sat looking at the fort, with his back to the Kentuckian.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the blood rushed to the ranger’s heart
with a terrible throb, for <em>he felt a hand laid on his extended
foot</em>!</p>

<p>Most men, at such a time, would have started.</p>

<p>Simon lay still. He could not afford to start. He did not
know who touched him, but he did know that while he kept
silence there was still hope in that darkness.</p>

<p>Slowly and noiselessly he turned his head, and felt a
thrill of relief as he distinguished the black outline of Boone’s
coon-skin cap. He knew that his friend had followed him,
and wanted to say something.</p>

<p>The position was now frightfully dangerous. Within a
few yards were twenty Indian warriors listening for them.</p>

<p>Within three feet was one more, with his back turned to
them.</p>

<p>Could the scouts communicate without being heard?</p>

<p>Kenton thought not, but he lay still, trusting to Boone’s
sagacity. In a moment more, the hand was removed, and
the form of Boone glided forward with no more apparent
effort than if he had been floating in water.</p>

<p>He said not a word, but he raised his left hand, and laid a
finger on the back of Kenton’s neck at the base of the skull,
then pointed to the Indian and tapped his knife.</p>

<p>Simon nodded his head in token of comprehension, and
slowly drew up, first one knee; then the other, till he was
crouching behind a tree not two feet from the Indian. Boone
lay quite still, while his comrade rose.</p>

<p>Then Kenton, holding his great knife-blade upwards, made
a single step forward, and lunged out at the back of the Indian’s
neck, dividing the spinal marrow with the skill of a
matador.</p>

<p>The head of the sentry fell forward on his breast, and he
slowly rolled over on his side, as if he had been dropping off
to sleep. He was stone dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Boone, listening intently, heard nothing but the low thud
of the knife as it cut through the soft bone and cartilage of
the spine, and the rustle in the dry grass as the Indian rolled
over.</p>

<p>As for Kenton, he was down on one knee the moment the
blow was struck, picking up the rifle that Boone had pushed
up to him, and glaring fiercely round through the darkness.</p>

<p>For fully a minute there was a dead silence, both rangers
with their senses keenly on the alert for the slightest
noise.</p>

<p>Then there was a rustle in the grass not far off, and the
low owl-hoot again broke the stillness.</p>

<p>Kenton himself answered it, and all was still again.</p>

<p>He knew well what it all meant. The nearest Indian on
the line <em>had heard the plunge of the knife</em>!</p>

<p>Doubtless he had suspected something, and called to his
neighbor.</p>

<p>The answer must have reassured him, for there were no
more signals for some time.</p>

<p>Then the ranger crept forward, and softly withdrew the
knife from where it stuck in the neck of the unhappy wretch,
replacing it in his own belt.</p>

<p>As he did so, Boone touched his foot once more, and he
looked back. Both the borderer and Ruby Roland were close
behind him crouching to the earth, and Boone silently pointed
to the fort, as if to urge a sudden dash forward.</p>

<p>Kenton beckoned them forward, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Run! both of ye. I’ll cover the rear and sculp this hyar
varmint.”</p>

<p>Boone nodded softly, and took Ruby by the hand.</p>

<p>From where they were, they could distinctly see the sharp
outlines of the pointed palisades that surrounded the fort, for
as Kenton had guessed, the line had been drawn in very close
during the darkness.</p>

<p>The only question that remained was whether there were a
second line of Indians close in or not.</p>

<p>If not, they were almost out of danger. If there were,
there was much yet to be done.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone and Ruby Roland crept toward the fort, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
without some little noise, but crouching low and making the
best speed they could.</p>

<p>The moment they started Kenton knew they were heard.
He heard a quick rustle of dry grass and dead leaves, a
heavy rushing through the brushwood, and a score of dark
forms leaped up and dashed toward the fort, yelling furiously.
He heard Boone utter the Shawnee war-whoop, to confuse
his enemies, and saw him and Ruby go flying among
the stumps that surrounded the fort, just as a ring of spitting
red flashes lighted up the woods, followed by a rattling
volley of rifles. Covered by the racket, and himself unobserved,
the reckless borderer passed his knife round the
head of the slain sentry and scalped him without more
ado.</p>

<p>Then he picked up the slain man’s rifle, and rushed forward
into the melee, whooping louder than any of them, and so
far unrecognized in the thick darkness.</p>

<p>But now, on a sudden, the people of the fort opened a
warm fire on the Indians outside, and the bullets began to
fly very unpleasantly near our three friends.</p>

<p>Kenton bounded forward, and beheld a confused group
of dark figures close under the walls, which he recognized
in a moment as Boone and Ruby surrounded by foes.</p>

<p>“Hooroar for ole Kaintuck!” shouted the ranger, throwing
all disguise to the winds, and exerting his powerful voice to
the utmost. “Go it, cunnel! Give ’em fits! Knock the
daylights out of the painted imps! So now!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he leveled the Indian’s rifle at the thickest of
the Indian group, fired, dropped it, leveled his own at a chief
who was rushing at him, and shot him dead, just as Boone
himself fired for the first time.</p>

<p>Then the two renowned Indian-fighters clubbed their heavy
rifles and fought like ten men to drive off the enemy and
protect little Ruby.</p>

<p>The girl was crouched on the ground between them, the
guns of the whole party were empty, and the conflict between
the two muscular borderers and the confused Indians
was by no means so unequal as might seem.</p>

<p>Suddenly a clear, commanding voice from the fort shouted:</p>

<p>“White men, drop, quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Like lightning both scouts obeyed, and a rattling volley
was fired, the bullets tearing through the Indians, and sending
the whole crowd to cover in a moment.</p>

<p>“To the gate, quick!” shouted the same voice.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, cunnel, here we come!” cried Kenton.</p>

<p>As he spoke he snatched up Ruby like a child, and dashed
away with her, followed by Boone.</p>

<p>A moment later the open gate of the fort was before them.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BACKWOODS LEADER.</span></h2>


<p>The morning dawned clear and bright over the fort and
village of Harrodsburg; and to the eye of a novice there
remained nothing to indicate that the Indian besiegers were
anywhere in the vicinity. The forest was quiet, and yet
full of life, the robins and blue birds came flitting round the
houses, and the smaller “chippy” birds came down into the
inclosure of the fort, and pecked about for scattered
crumbs.</p>

<p>Harrodsburg was a typical village of its kind, the old frontier
post fortified against Indians. Its houses were built in
close rows around a square, the intervals between them protected
by heavy palisades, forming a continuous line with
the walls. At each angle rose a large block-house, flanking
the bare curtains, and a small ditch encompassed the
whole.</p>

<p>On the morning succeeding the daring entrance of Ruby
and her two protectors to the fort, a handsome and distinguished
looking man of about twenty-five, dressed in a curious
but very picturesque mixture of military uniform and
backwoods frock and leggins, stood in the upper story of
one of the block-houses, looking out over the gate through a
loophole, and talking to Ruby Roland.</p>

<p>This young man, whose peculiar air of intelligence and
resolution marked him as a person of no common mold, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
none other than the afterward celebrated George Rogers
Clark, a man who had already inspired more hope and confidence
in the breasts of the people of Kentucky than any
other leader had yet succeeded in doing.</p>

<p>Colonel Clark had just returned from the parent State of
Virginia, with twelve hundred pounds of Continental money,
a colonel’s commission, public orders “to defend Kentucky,”
and private orders to—ah! <em>that</em> no one knew, though many
would have given much to satisfy their curiosity. He had issued
a call to the settlers of Kentucky to organize for a secret
expedition, and companies had been formed at different points
all along the frontiers of the present States of Pennsylvania,
Virginia and Ohio.</p>

<p>And now, when his plans were almost ripe, the ardent
young leader was caught and caged in Harrodsburg, by a miserable
Shawnee chief named Blackfish, and less than three
hundred warriors. Such are the accidents that conspire
against the most successful military chiefs.</p>

<p>Colonel Clark was looking thoughtfully out of the loophole,
but listening to the words of his fair companion with
great attention, nevertheless. There were no eavesdroppers
near, and the girl appeared to be talking very earnestly.</p>

<p>“If you will come, colonel,” she said in conclusion, “I can
promise that you shall be welcomed by all the tribes of forest
and prairie that obey my father. You will only have to contend
with the British, for our people are already tired of the
yoke, and long to throw it off.”</p>

<p>Colonel Clark remained silently looking out of the loophole,
as if he had not heard what she said. He seemed to be absorbed
in watching the maneuvers of a herd of cattle that had
been driven out of the fort-gate as soon as daylight advanced,
and when the besiegers had retired to a respectful distance.</p>

<p>This was done every day, and, curiously enough, the Indians
seldom or never molested the herdsmen, as long as they
kept within the clearing surrounding the fort.</p>

<p>Without answering Ruby, the young colonel pointed to the
cattle, and said:</p>

<p>“There are Indians in the high grass behind those cows.
See how they act.”</p>

<p>Ruby frowned a little impatiently, and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are not talking of that, colonel. I brought you a
certain proposition from Tabac, the Grand Sachem and Grand
Door of the Wabash. Have you any answer for it?”</p>

<p>Clark smiled provokingly. He was a man of great penetration
and tact, as the reader will discover in the course of
this book, and for some reason he did not see fit to give the
girl a full answer at the moment.</p>

<p>“You see that field,” he said, pointing; “now, Mademoiselle
Roland, if you wait here half an hour I’ll show you
some of the tallest kind of fun that you ever saw. And after
that, I’ll be ready to talk business to you.”</p>

<p>So saying, he vanished from the block-house, with very
scant ceremony for the lady it contained, leaving her overwhelmed
with surprise and mortification, not unmixed with
great anger at herself.</p>

<p>Ruby Roland, left to herself, clenched her little hands and
stamped her foot angrily, saying:</p>

<p>“Why did I come here through all these dangers to meet
this handsome, insolent American, who laughs at me? Does he
think I am some common squaw, that he leaves me thus?
Now, by heavens, if he does not treat me better at our next
interview, he shall find that Ruby Roland can go out as she
came in, and woe betide all here if she does, and his handsome,
insolent face worst of all. Oh, I could strike him
dead!”</p>

<p>From all which tirade, it became evident that Miss Ruby
was very much piqued at Colonel Clark’s neglect, while, at
the same time, much struck with his personal appearance.
Whatever her proposition might have been, she was not destined
to obtain an answer to it that morning, for events speedily
took place which interested her in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Looking down toward the gate, she saw reckless Simon
Kenton standing by its open leaves, with two or three other
men, and saw Colonel Clark approach and give the scout
some orders. Simon nodded, sauntered out of the gate, with
Boone and five or six hunters, and strolled carelessly toward
the field in front of the gate where the cows were feeding,
and where the animals appeared to be very uneasy—a sure
sign of Indians being near them.</p>

<p>Ruby, watching the length of the palisades, soon after saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the colonel himself, with a long file of men, emerge from behind
the block-house at the further angle of the fort, and steal
off into the woods, in the very direction from which she had
come the night before.</p>

<p>Interested in spite of herself, she watched and listened for
signs of the enemy. All was quiet, and it seemed as if the
besiegers must have retired from the place but for the behavior
of the cattle.</p>

<p>She saw Simon and the hunters stop short in a turnip-patch
which had been cleared close under the fire of the fort,
and begin to thin the vegetables, as if at their ordinary work.</p>

<p>Every now and then one of the men in the field would
shout out some witticism to those in the fort about the Indians
having run away, and all this time the lurking savages
gave no token of their whereabouts.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, a loud yell was raised from the woods, in
rear of the field where the cattle were feeding, followed by a
rattling volley of rifles; and the next moment Clark and his
Kentuckians darted out of the cover, routing out some fifty
Indians, who leaped up and stood bewildered.</p>

<p>At the same moment Kenton and the men in the turnip-patch
raised a yell of triumph, and poured a second volley into
the now demoralized savages, charging in at the instant of
firing.</p>

<p>The Shawnees made a feeble, scattering return, and then
fled in great haste, the borderers rushing out after them in hot
pursuit—the sound of yells and shots dying away in the distance.</p>

<p>At least an hour elapsed before they returned, and then
Ruby was at the gate to meet them. She was anxious to
know what had happened. The first person she saw was
Colonel Clark, who came up at the head of his men, smiling,
as if greatly pleased.</p>

<p>He came straight to Ruby, and addressed her before all the
people:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Roland, Blackfish decamped last night, as
soon as he heard you had got in. We have driven away this
little body of spies, and Harrodsburg is safe. Mademoiselle,
<em>I accept your proposition</em>.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SECRET EXPEDITION.</span></h2>


<p>The day was hot and sultry, in early summer, about a year
afterward, on the broad, shallow stream of the Kanawha River,
as a flotilla of large flat-boats, known to the voyageurs as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bateaux</i>,
was steadily following its way down the stream, assisted
by the current, and urged by four or six long sweeps in each
boat, pulled by two or three men apiece.</p>

<p>The bateaux were long, broad flat-boats, square at each
end, hastily constructed from green plank, on the borders of
the river, like nothing but great scows. There were seven of
these rude but effective craft, all full of armed men, and holding
about two hundred and fifty souls, all told.</p>

<p>Among these was a very small sprinkling of women and
children; but the far greater proportion were stout, bronzed
backwoodsmen, apt at a fight, and unerring in aim.</p>

<p>The leading boat of the flotilla was distinguished by a little
house, or cabin, built in its center, on the summit of which
rose a flag-staff, from which drooped a small white flag, bearing
the pine-tree and coiled rattle-snake of the infant nation,
which had not as yet been replaced by the memorable Stars
and Stripes.</p>

<p>By this flag-staff, glass in hand, stood the leader of the expedition,
Colonel George Rogers Clark, and by him a lad of
about fifteen, slender in figure, of very dark complexion, who
wore the same half-military dress as his leader—the hunting-shirt
and leggings being fringed with gold lace, and the fur
cap faced with a gilt plate of military device. Both wore
swords and pistols, with officers’ scarlet sashes around the
loins, to indicate authority.</p>

<p>“We shall get to the Ohio in an hour hence, colonel, if we
keep up this speed,” remarked the boy officer, as Clark put
down the glass with which he had been scanning the river
ahead.</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Clark, gravely. “We shall get news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
there, at all events, Mr. Frank. Have you the morning report
yet, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, colonel,” replied young Frank, promptly; “there
are but three sick in the command, and one of them is a
woman.”</p>

<p>Clark frowned, and made an impatient movement.</p>

<p>“These women are always in the way,” he said. “One
would think that an expedition of this sort would put them
out of conceit to come; but there’s no stopping the willful
hussies—and they’re sure to fall sick just when we don’t want
them. I wish they’d stay where they belong.”</p>

<p>The boy officer—he was Clark’s adjutant—laughed, as he
said:</p>

<p>“Well, colonel, you know it’s no use fighting them. They
will have their own way, as you say. This one I speak of
isn’t rightly sick, but she met with an accident, yesterday, in
passing the rapids. To save her husband, who was tired out,
she took his place at the oar, with two of Captain Helm’s
men, and when the oar struck a rock, during the passage, all
three were sent flying and badly bruised. That’s all of our
sick-list.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the commander, a little mollified, “that’s
not so bad; but one thing I’m determined on, adjutant: when
we get to the falls, I ship every blessed woman in the command.
I won’t be bothered with them. And as for the married
men, if they grumble, by Jove, they shall go, too. I
wish there wasn’t a woman left to get in the way. They are
unmitigated nuisances.”</p>

<p>The little adjutant laughed.</p>

<p>“Why, colonel, they told me you left Kentucky in company
with a woman—old Tobacco’s daughter. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she was only a child,” said Clark, carelessly; “a
plucky child, too, by the bye, and as good at hiding as an old
Shawnee warrior. But we didn’t travel long together. She
brought me certain propositions from—well, never mind who,
sir; that’s my affair—and when we had talked over the business,
I packed her off to her adopted father. I may see her
again, if this expedition succeeds, but I doubt if I should
know her again. So much for your sneer, youngster.”</p>

<p>The boy adjutant laughed again, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“So you’ll see her again, if the expedition succeeds, sir?
Then I suppose we’re going to St. Vincent’s?”</p>

<p>Clark, who was again looking out ahead, put down the
glass, and turned abruptly on his small adjutant, laying his
hand heavily on his shoulder with a grim smile, as he said:</p>

<p>“Look here, young man, you’re a smart lad, but not so
smart as you think. This expedition is going—<em>where I
choose</em>. Do you quite comprehend? You’re as curious, sir,
by Jove, as if you were a woman. Ask me no questions, if
you don’t want to be put under arrest. I dare say the whole
lot of you would like to know my intentions; but you will
have to find me out of my wits first. Now, sir, take the
canoe, and pay your morning visit to the fleet. Bring me
back a report of the condition of the arms and ammunition,
by the time we reach Arbuckle’s Station, and be quick.”</p>

<p>It was evident that the commander was somewhat irritated
with his staff officer for presuming to question him, and the
lad turned away very promptly, for the colonel was universally
dreaded when he looked angry, which was not often.</p>

<p>Adjutant Frank descended to the deck, and jumped overboard
into a canoe towing alongside, with which he proceeded
to visit the other boats of the fleet; while Clark, left alone,
paced the roof of the little cabin in silence.</p>

<p>In a short time the river began to grow much broader, the
current slower, and the monotonous waste of forest on either
bank was broken in places by clearings. At last they saw before
them a lofty point, nearly bare of timber, jutting out on
the right, and beheld the straight brown banks of the broad
Ohio, barring their further progress in a straight line. The
Kanawha became merged in the Ohio.</p>

<p>On the point to the north, known as Point Pleasant, stood
a straggling collection of log-houses, inclosed with a palisade,
and bearing the usual appurtenances of a frontier fort, including
a pine-tree flag. As the people on the bateau caught
sight of the fort, they gave three ringing cheers, responded to
by the instant rushing out of a crowd of people from the
houses, running pell-mell to see what was coming.</p>

<p>Half an hour after, they were passing in front of the fort,
when a boat, containing a military officer and a dozen rowers,
pulled out to intercept them, and Captain Leander Arbuckle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
commandant and principal owner of the settlement, boarded
Clark’s boat, and saluted the colonel as if he knew him well.</p>

<p>“Whither bound, colonel?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Down the river to defend Kentucky,” said Clark. “Secret
orders.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the captain, eagerly, “then I can put
you in the way to checkmate an Indian raid, if you will join
me. Only the day before yesterday I beat off a great war-party
of two hundred and fifty men of the Six Nations.
They crossed the river here, and have gone on for the settlements
on the Greenbrier river, so as to take your friends in
Kentucky in the rear. Now, colonel, if you will join me, we
can overtake these fellows and utterly exterminate them.
Will you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Clark, gravely; “I can not do it. My orders,
if obeyed, will punish these fellows better than by following
them. The settlers must take care of themselves.”</p>

<p>Captain Arbuckle drew himself up stiffly.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand that you refuse to help me save our
imperiled fellow-citizens, colonel?”</p>

<p>“You are, sir,” said Clark, firmly. “If you want to follow
a will-o’-the-wisp, you must do it alone. I must do my
duty, which forbids me to stop a single hour on my way.”</p>

<p>Arbuckle looked perplexed and vexed.</p>

<p>“But where, then, are you going?”</p>

<p>“Where my orders take me, sir; and that is a secret.”</p>

<p>Arbuckle looked angry. He lifted his hat with very stiff
courtesy, and said, as he turned away:</p>

<p>“Then I have the honor to bid you farewell, Colonel Clark,
and to wish you better manners.”</p>

<p>“And I, sir,” said Clark, with equal bantering, “shall have
the honor to demand an apology for those words, when I
have done my duty.”</p>

<p>Arbuckle wheeled round haughtily.</p>

<p>“Prove me wrong, sir, and I’ll give you any satisfaction
you wish. Good-morning, sir.”</p>

<p>A moment after, captain and colonel parted, like two peppery
Southerners, as they were, ready to cut each other’s
throats on a point of etiquette.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56620/56620-h/56620-h.htm#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">A FRONTIER CAMP.</span></h2>


<p>The site of the present city of Louisville was but a desolate
wilderness a hundred years ago; when forest and prairie
divided the banks of the river, and the game roamed, unfrightened
by white or red. Here, late in the month of June, 1778,
a considerable camp was pitched, the rows of fires and tethered
horses announcing the presence of several hundred men,
while the woodland costume of the occupants proclaimed
them to be unmitigated backwoods settlers and hunters.</p>

<p>A large, powerful man, black-haired and bearded, with tremendous
shoulders, stood by the banks of the Ohio, in company
with Boone and Kenton, all three watching the stream
above them, where the outlines of Clark’s bateaux were readily
discernible, coming down the river. Below them could
be heard the roaring noise of those steep and dangerous rapids,
now known as Louisville Falls; and at this point had
Clark ordered a concentration of all the forces raised to defend
Kentucky.</p>

<p>The big man was the renowned Captain Harrod, of Harrodsburg,
whose company was one of those designed for the
secret expedition, whose purpose was as yet unknown to all
but the leader.</p>

<p>“I’m thinkin’ we’ll know all about the colonel’s plans middlin’
quick, when he comes in,” remarked Kenton, as he leaned
on his rifle. “The boys are in fur a scrimmage, but they
won’t go unless they know whar they’re goin’ to.”</p>

<p>“You may bet your boots on that,” said Harrod, dryly.
“I hain’t no objections to tacklin’ Old Nick, ef I know whar
I’m goin’; but I ain’t to be fooled with <em>secret orders</em> by no
George Clark, when I c’u’d turn him over my knee and spank
him.”</p>

<p>Daniel Boone turned his quiet blue eyes on Harrod,
saying:</p>

<p>“Ain’t you a little hard on Colonel Clark, Billy? He ain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
asked you to go on a wild-goose chase yet. I know you’re a
good man of your hands, Billy, but Clark’s no boy. Wait till
he tells us where we are to go, before you get mad. He holds
the State commission, remember, to order us all.”</p>

<p>Harrod shook his head sulkily.</p>

<p>“He’s a good sodger, Dan’l, no discount on that; but I
don’t like these hyar secret orders. Why don’t he come out
and tell us whar he’s goin’ like a man?”</p>

<p>“Because there are spies round, Billy,” said Boone, boldly.
“Who knows but what the British General at Detroit would
hear all about his doings, if he divided the secret with a lot
of fellows like them?” indicating the camp with a scornful
gesture; “so full of whisky—when they can get it, that a
child might suck them dry.”</p>

<p>“There are reason in cunnel’s words, Billy,” said Kenton,
quietly. “Leastwise there ain’t no use talkin’, till Cunnel
Clark comes. See, the head boat’s landin’ on Corn Island,
and I guess we’ll hev to foller them into camp there.”</p>

<p>In fact, at this moment, Clark’s boats put in to an island
that lay in the center of the river, and proceeded to disembark
their crews, in sight of the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>Shortly after, a bark canoe shot out from the island, crossed
the shallow belt of water that separated it from the south
bank, and landed the same little officer already referred to
as Adjutant Frank.</p>

<p>This smart little officer came strutting up to Big Bill
Harrod, with a slender rapier clanking at his heels, and
asked:</p>

<p>“Where shall I find Captain Bowman, the commandant,
sir?”</p>

<p>Harrod looked down, half-contemptuously, at this tiny officer,
whose head about reached his breast, and answered with
a question:</p>

<p>“And what the Old Nick do <em>you</em> want of Joe Bowman,
bubby? He ain’t used to suckin’ ’lasses candy.”</p>

<p>The little officer laughed merrily, without seeming in the
least abashed.</p>

<p>“I see, you’re not Bowman, my man, for I was told he
was a gentleman. Captain Kenton, where is Bowman?”</p>

<p>Kenton started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, how the Old Scratch do you know my name, sonny?
I disremember ever seeing you before.”</p>

<p>“I am Colonel Clark’s adjutant, gentlemen,” said Frank,
pulling up with considerable dignity, notwithstanding his
small size. “If you’ve no civil answer to give me, I’ll go
elsewhere! I carry <em>orders</em>!”</p>

<p>“Captain Bowman is down in camp, with Captain Dillard,
sir,” said Daniel Boone, suddenly stepping forward and
saluting the other with respect. “Don’t mind these rough
fellows, adjutant; it’s their Kentucky way, and they mean no
harm. I’ll go to the camp with you.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said Harrod, gruffly. “That younker said
something about my not bein’ a gentleman. I ain’t goin’ to
be talked to that way by none of George Clark’s whipper-snappers.”</p>

<p>In a moment the little officer had wheeled sharp round,
and marched up to the huge borderer.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he said, defiantly, “I said you were no gentleman,
to answer a civil question as you did. I repeat it.
Now then, name your time and place, and I’ll fight you!”</p>

<p>For a moment the giant looked down at the slender form
of this incarnation of pluck, pure and simple, as if he was
puzzled. At last he burst into a roar of laughter, for he was
a good-natured fellow after all, and said:</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, arter all, little bantam. I durstn’t
fight ye, <em>that</em> I know, for I couldn’t see to hit ye, ef ye stood
edgewise. Let’s shake hands. I’m Bill Harrod of Harrodsburg,
and by Gosh, I’m sorry I riled ye. Put it there.”</p>

<p>He held out a broad and horny palm, into which Frank
insinuated his own diminutive hand, enduring a painful
squeeze with great fortitude. Then all four, in perfect harmony,
proceeded to the camp, where the senior captain,
Joseph Bowman of Virginia, welcomed the little adjutant
with great courtesy, and received the latter’s message.</p>

<p>“Colonel Clark’s compliments, gentlemen, and he has
gone into camp on Corn Island. The river is fordable here,
and he wishes you to bring over your companies and camp
with him, when he will announce the object of the expedition,
and call for volunteers.”</p>

<p>The news was spread from mouth to mouth with wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
rapidity, the half-disciplined frontiersmen crowding
round their commanders to hear the message, in a manner
that would have caused a martinet to despair of their military
character.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Bowman issued the order, like an old officer.</p>

<p>“Git ready to move camp, boys; and look sharp.”</p>

<p>Inside of ten minutes, three companies of mounted riflemen
stood by their horses’ heads, silent and obedient, and
when Bowman rode into the ford, there was not a single
straggler left behind.</p>

<p>The little adjutant crossed in his canoe, and on the further
bank they found three more companies, drawn up in front
of their camp, all silent and orderly, and anxiously expecting
the news, about to be promulgated, of the destination of
the expedition.</p>

<p>Colonel Clark was the only mounted man on the island,
and he rode up, and greeted his allies with great courtesy.</p>

<p>“You will go into camp at the other end of the island,
captain,” he said, to Bowman. “There are too many of the
enemy’s Indians about, to trust a camp on shore to their
annoyances. Go into camp, dismount your men, and be
ready for dress parade at sunset. I will then announce the
orders.”</p>

<p>There was an evident disposition, among the rough borderers
of Harrod’s and Dillard’s companies, to grumble at
this order, but Clark checked it in a manner that showed
his knowledge of frontier nature. Riding down the column,
he called out:</p>

<p>“What, gentlemen, have we a lot of curious old women
in the ranks? If so, please to ride home. I want nothing
but brave men, where <em>I</em> am going. For shame! Don’t you
know me well enough to know that George Clark has a
meaning for whatever he says? Forward, gentlemen, and
obey orders like men!”</p>

<p>In a moment a dead silence fell on the three companies,
and the camp was formed with marvelous expedition and order.</p>

<p>An hour after that, at the call of the bugle, six hundred
men were under arms in a hollow square, and the backwoods
leader addressed them, amid intense anxiety from all to hear
the news.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SECRET DISCLOSED.</span></h2>


<p>“Gentlemen of Kentucky and Virginia,” began the colonel,
“for six long years have we striven on the dark and
bloody ground to keep a foothold on the inheritance we are
earning for our children. For three years of that time, our
whole land has been fighting against fearful odds on the side
of the unnatural mother country. Not content with hiring
Hessians to come over and murder us, they have bribed the
savages to fire our houses and scalp women and children,
from Cherry Valley to Harrodsburg.”</p>

<p>Here there was a growl of assent, “That’s so.” “Cuss
’em.” “We’ll get square, some day.”</p>

<p>“Soldiers,” continued Clark, addressing them by the title
he knew they were most proud of, “the time has come when
we must turn the tables on the British. Saratoga has shown
them that we can beat their best troops, and all along the Atlantic
States they are running like whipped hounds!”</p>

<p>A tremendous yell greeted the reference.</p>

<p>“Now,” cried the colonel, “since we are safe on the
east, let us turn to the west. The Indians have tormented
us long enough. We chase them, and ’tis like attacking a
swarm of wasps. We can not catch them. Well, boys,
what do you do when the wasps get too troublesome?”</p>

<p>He paused, as if to await a reply. There was an awkward
silence for near a minute. Then Daniel Boone, who
stood near Clark, and out of the ranks, observed in his clear,
quiet tones:</p>

<p>“We hunt for the nest, and burn it up, some night, colonel.”</p>

<p>“Right, old comrade!” exclaimed the young leader, amid
a whispered chorus of excited comments; “<em>we find the nest,
and burn it up</em>. Well, gentlemen, these wasps come not
from one nest, but <em>three</em>: and their names are Detroit, St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Vincent’s,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56620/56620-h/56620-h.htm#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Kaskaskia. Detroit is a fortified town, beyond
our reach. St. Vincent’s is too strong for us as yet.
Kaskaskia, the furthest of all, is the most dangerous to Kentucky.
Secure in their distance from us, the British think
they need fear nothing. Gentlemen, I have orders from
Governor Henry of Virginia <em>to take Kaskaskia</em> and save Kentucky
forever. Who will volunteer to go with me, and
strangle the snake in his den?”</p>

<p>There was a deep silence following this speech, at the end
of which Captain Harrod stepped forward and made a
characteristic speech:</p>

<p>“Colonel George Rogers Clark, <em>Esq</em>uire: Sir, I’ve be’n a-grumblin’
a long time about these hyar <em>secret orders</em>, and, I
reckon, be’n makin’ a darned jackmule of myself about it.
Colonel, I take it all back, and damme, sir, I’ll lift the ha’r
off any feller as says you ain’t a full team and two mules to
spar’, with a yaller dawg hitched under the tail-board. I’m
with you, colonel, while thar’s a drop of blood in my body,
and these hyar Harrodsburg hu’sters, they travel with me, you
kin bet all the clothes you ever owned. Thar!”</p>

<p>A rousing cheer from Harrod’s company applauded the
speech, and it was followed by equally warm indorsement
from every captain and company, with one exception.</p>

<p>This was captain Dillard, whose company was raised
near Harrod’s, and entertained considerable jealousy of the
others.</p>

<p>Captain Dillard, when questioned point-blank by Clark,
before the rest, replied:</p>

<p>“Waal, colonel, ef I’d knowed you war a-goin’ on any
sich a wild-goose chase as this hyar, I wouldn’t have
pledged my credit to the boys, and asked ’em to come.
You’re a-goin’ a long way, and it’s more than likely you’ll git
beat. Ef so, whar are ye? Worse off than ever, a thousand
miles from hum, and no one to help ye?”</p>

<p>The cautious captain’s words were not without their effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in damping the men’s spirits, and it was with great adroitness
that Clark replied, in closing the discussion:</p>

<p>“That’s all provided for, captain. We have bateaux
enough to carry us all down the Mississippi to New Orleans,
where the Spanish and French will be only too glad to pay
us like princes to fight the Indians for them. <em>But we shall
not get beat.</em> We shall take them by surprise, kill the
British soldiers, save Kentucky, and come home worth two
hundred and fifty acres of land apiece. Governor Henry has
promised it to us, and I have the patent in my pocket. Now,
gentlemen, since you’re all agreed to follow me, disperse to
your quarters. Captain Bowman, you are officer of the day.
Secure all the boats, and place sentries at the ford. Let no
man cross without my orders. I wish to see the captains in
my cabin at once. Adjutant, dismiss the parade.”</p>

<p>As stiffly and formally as if nothing had happened, he
signified by his manner that discussion was over. The officers
returned to their companies; the little adjutant called up
the sergeants and received reports; and finally parade was
dismissed, with a ceremony rarely seen among the rough
frontiersmen.</p>

<p>Guards were set around the boat and at the fort, and the
whole camp was soon a buzz of conflicting voices on the
prospects of the famous expedition to Kaskaskia. Some of
Dillard’s men were disposed to gloomy prophecies, influenced
by their captain, but the greater part were light-hearted, reckless
hunters, to whom the idea of a distant and dangerous
expedition acted as a charm.</p>

<p>These laughed at the croakers, and prognosticated great
things of the expedition, as they devoured their rations, which
the foresight of Clark had collected at the falls in large
quantities. None knew better than Clark the road through
the stomach to a soldier’s heart, and none appreciated it
better.</p>

<p>At last all was quiet, and the fires dying away, the camp
was buried in profound slumber.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Two hours after midnight Colonel Clark was awakened by
a touch on his shoulder. Starting up, he saw the little adjutant
before him, who spoke at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Colonel, the whole of Dillard’s men, with their first
lieutenant, have deserted, and forded the river on the way
home.”</p>

<p>In a moment Clark was on his feet, broad awake.</p>

<p>“Have they taken their horses? Has any one else gone?
Have the sentries at the ford played us false?”</p>

<p>“Not one, sir. The scoundrels crossed higher up, leaving
their horses in camp. Dillard remains here. I only found it
out five minutes ago, while making my rounds.”</p>

<p>Clark laid his hand on the boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Frank, you’re little, but you’re worth ten giants. Call the
bugler and sound to arms. I’ll send you after them, lad.”</p>

<p>The leader walked quickly out to the parade-ground, and
inside of five minutes the bugle sounded and the men came
filing out of their bivouacs in silence, forming with a celerity
and order that veteran soldiers could not have excelled. They
were all well used to night alarms, and expected an Indian
attack at least.</p>

<p>When the colonel, in a few brief, nervous words, informed
them of the cowardly treachery of their comrades, and
called for a party to pursue them, there was a roar of indignation.
Every man in camp clamored to go after the “durned
ornary skunks,” as they called them, and Clark hastily selected
the first score who presented themselves, mounted them on
the horses of the deserters, and sent them off with Captain
Harrod and the little adjutant, with orders to shoot all who
resisted.</p>

<p>Away went the capturing party at full speed across the
ford, and the rest of the night was spent in excited discussion,
for all were too angry to sleep.</p>

<p>About an hour before noon Harrod’s party returned with
seven or eight of the captured deserters, reporting the rest as
scattered to the four winds, and the rest of the day was spent
in selecting the companies to go to Kaskaskia, while the rest
were detailed to go to Kentucky and defend the frontiers during
the absence of their comrades.</p>

<p>Then on the next day, the 24th June, 1778, ten bateaux,
carrying four strong companies of hardy rangers, dropped
down the rapids of the Ohio, and set off on their dangerous
expedition to the unknown wilds of the Illinois country;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
while, as if to appall them with the terrors of superstition, the
sun passed into a total eclipse, and darkness covered the
heavens at the instant they entered the passage.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56620/56620-h/56620-h.htm#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> There let
us leave them, on their venturesome way, and turn to the
great post which they were trying to reach.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">KASKASKIA.</span></h2>


<p>The Fourth of July is generally a hot day. The Fourth
of July, 1778, was a particularly hot day around the town of
Kaskaskia, as it basked in the sun on the banks of two rivers,
the tin roofs of its quaint old houses shining like mirrors.
Kaskaskia, a hundred years ago, was like Quebec to-day, a
quaint, rambling town of steep, narrow streets, nominally
English, actually French in language and sentiment. Founded
two years before Philadelphia, it was at that time the emporium
of Indian trade, and far ahead of the infant St. Louis,
eighty miles further up.</p>

<p>What changes a century makes! To-day Kaskaskia is a decayed
village, and St. Louis a city of palaces.</p>

<p>On a rounded bluff opposite the town stood a handsome
stone fort, with rows of bright brass guns trained on the
place, and that so closely as to obviate the necessity of walls
around the houses.</p>

<p>Kaskaskia was safe from the Indians for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, the fort frightened the thievish ones; second, the
place was full of trappers and traders who had intermarried
with every tribe in the West. This last point is the grand secret
of the control which the French have always exercised
over the Indians. At the present day it turns into friends
and allies thousands of the same race in the Hudson’s Bay
Territories, that are relentless foes to white men in the American
Territories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In Kaskaskia, on that sultry Fourth, a hundred years ago,
trader and Indian could be seen side by side in every shady
place, smoking over bargains in furs like old friends.</p>

<p>The blazing sun at last dipped behind the western prairies,
and a gentle breeze came sighing up the Mississippi, when
Monsieur Rocheblave, the French-English Governor, who was
sitting by the open window of the government house at the
top of the hill, suddenly spoke to his wife.</p>

<p>“Coralie, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma chere</i>, I do believe I see Mademoiselle Roland,
and that she is coming hither. Yes, it is she indeed.”</p>

<p>Madame Rocheblave, who was lying on a sofa fanning herself
languidly, bleated out, with a whining, querulous tone:</p>

<p>“Rubie? What can the girl want? I declare I wish my
cousin Roland had done any thing in the world rather than
leave that wild creature in the way he did, half the time for
me to take care of, the other half to that ugly Indian they
call the Grand Door of the Wabash. I wish he’d keep her
altogether. She has lost all the manner of society, and tells
the truth so quick and plain that she lacerates my feelings.”</p>

<p>M. Rocheblave had risen to look out of the window
better.</p>

<p>“For all that, my angel,” he said, soothingly, “we must
remember that mademoiselle your cousin is a very important
person. She represents the union between us and the tribes,
a link carefully forged by her illustrious father, at his own
cost, which <em>must</em> be maintained. Therefore, Coralie, be polite
to mademoiselle, who is about to become our guest. It is
a great privilege you and I enjoy, to entertain a princess.”</p>

<p>“A princess!” said madame, ill-temperedly. “I’ve had
enough of these wild princesses. What does she come for?
It’s not time for her visit for two months yet.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that the visit portends something to us,” said
the Governor. “At all events, <em>I</em> shall not be wanting in respect
to our illustrious guest.”</p>

<p>And the Governor hastily arranged his costume, and left
the room, to greet the approaching personage.</p>

<p>At the principal gate of the “palace,” as it was styled, he
paused, to watch the progress of a cavalcade, coming up the
street.</p>

<p>At the head rode, on a very handsome dappled mustang, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
little friend Ruby Roland, dressed in gorgeous velvets and brocades,
heavily laced with gold, and loaded with jewelry. All
the finery that the wealth of a tribe could lavish on her, was
displayed on her trim figure, and she rode her spirited little
horse like a man, with all a man’s ease and dexterity.</p>

<p>She carried no arms, but this was compensated for by her
escort, consisting of twelve grim-looking chiefs, armed to the
teeth.</p>

<p>The Governor bowed very low to this strangely-situated
girl, at once perfect lady and Indian princess, and himself assisted
her to dismount from her horse, while a score of obedient
servants came running out to perform the same service
to her escort.</p>

<p>For every one in the town knew by this time that a great
embassy was come from “La Grande Porte.” The chiefs with
Ruby were recognized as being the heads of twelve independent
tribes, united under the great confederacy of the Wabash,
and such chiefs always expected deferential treatment.</p>

<p>The Governor embraced his cousin by marriage in the most
courtly French style, and shook hands with all the chiefs in
turn, welcoming them with a string of French and Indian
compliments together, and ushering them into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Here Madame la Gouverneuse, who had recovered her outward
equanimity, whatever her inward feelings, embraced
Ruby with a cordiality that would have deceived any male
beholder, and which the quick-witted girl herself penetrated
in an instant.</p>

<p>Then, after a sumptuous feast on the most unsubstantial
of French pastry and ice cream, articles devoured with intense
relish by the wild sons of the prairie, the Governor opened
negotiations by a delicate hint that business was in order.</p>

<p>Ruby at once became spokeswoman for her party, and proceeded
to explain the object of her visit in a speech which
excited general grunts of approbation from her stoical attendants.</p>

<p>“We have come,” said the girl, in the metaphorical Indian
style, “from the banks of the great river to the east, to the
father of all waters. We are few as a flock of antelopes,
but behind us are our brothers, like the buffalo, without number.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
From the great fresh sea on the north, by the country
of the Michigans, to the great river Ohio, that never fails, we
are one house, and that house has one door, who is our Red
Father. The Grand Door has opened to let us forth, to bring
great words to our French father. Tabac has spoken, and if
our French Father listen to his words it is well. If not, we
will go back, and the door will be shut.”</p>

<p>“The French Father is dead,” said Rocheblave, cautiously.
“He can not hear my red brethren’s words. We have an
English father now, who gives us blankets and guns. Let the
chiefs talk to him.”</p>

<p>Rocheblave, though of French parents, was entirely devoted
to the English government, and he hoped by speaking as he
did, to check the proposition he felt, rather than saw, was
coming.</p>

<p>Ruby proceeded with simple directness to her mission.</p>

<p>“The Great Spirit has sent a bird to his children,” she said,
“to speak with a straight tongue and tell us the truth. He
tells us that the French Father is <em>not</em> dead. He has been
asleep for many years, but now is awake. He calls to his red-children
to arouse and drive out the fork-tongued English who
have stolen his lands, and hired the red-men to make war on
the Big-Knives (Americans). The French Father has made
friends with the Big-Knives, and has declared war against the
English. My father is French and ought to love his French
Father. The Grand Door is open, and if the Governor of
Kaskaskia is wise, he will enter into our house, and forsake
the fork-tongues forever, as we have. I have spoken.”</p>

<p>The Governor was astounded. This was the first intelligence
he had received of the American alliance with France,
so lately concluded. He could hardly credit it. Therefore,
he said:</p>

<p>“Is my daughter sure that the bird spoke true? There
are lying birds about, sent by the rebellious Big-Knives. Let
my red brothers beware of such.”</p>

<p>“The bird spoke true,” said Ruby, firmly. “The tribes of
the Wabash are ashamed to have served the English. Henceforth
they befriend the Big-Knives, as their French Father
wishes them. I have spoken.”</p>

<p>And the twelve chiefs grunted an emphatic assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Rocheblave was puzzled, and temporized. He said:</p>

<p>“This is a grave matter. I must consult the old men and
warriors. I will give an answer to the Grand Door at noon
to-morrow. Is it good?”</p>

<p>“It is not good,” said Ruby, rising. “To-morrow we will
come, but the Grand Door will be shut. The Governor of
Kaskaskia must knock ere it be opened.”</p>

<p>So saying, she swept from the room, followed by her dusky
escort, leaving Rocheblave astonished, while madame whined:</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> Why did my cousin Roland make such a
fool of himself? I told you she was a barbarian.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE FORT.</span></h2>


<p>The night closed in over Kaskaskia, cool and pleasant after
the sultry day. There was no moon, but the stars were
uncommonly brilliant, and there was no difficulty in traveling.
The Governor of Kaskaskia, a few days before, had
been exercising the militia of the neighboring country, with
considerable force of Indian allies; for some vague rumors
had reached him of a possible raid by the rebel Virginians.
All along the banks of the Mississippi scouts and spies were
stationed with swift horses, to give notice of any force ascending
the river. But, as the days wore on, and no one
came, the vigilance of the townspeople had slacked.</p>

<p>Guard was mounted regularly at the fort, and there were
several hundred militia in the town; but the parades were
more formal than useful, and twenty men were judged sufficient
for the defense of the fort.</p>

<p>Governor Rocheblave retired to rest that night, somewhat
disturbed in mind. The message from old Tabac had puzzled
and annoyed him, but he was too confident of his own ability
to manage the Indians to fear for the issue of next day’s
conference.</p>

<p>He sat up till ten o’clock, preparing an artful speech, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
followed by munificent presents, and finally went to bed
hopeful of success.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ruby and her red friends were hospitably quartered
in an empty building near the “palace,” and to all appearance
were settled for the night, when the rest of the
townspeople were asleep.</p>

<p>About three-quarters of a mile above the town, on the opposite
side of the river Kaskaskia, stood the farm-house of
Monsieur Picard, a worthy market-gardener, who supplied the
town with vegetables; and around this house, about an hour
after dark, events were taking place which would have alarmed
the Governor considerably, had he known them.</p>

<p>Monsieur Picard and his family, in their night-clothes, and
all pale with terror, were surrounded by a crowd of rough-looking
men, who were questioning them about the town, in
English.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu, messieurs</i>,” said the unhappy gardener, “eef
you vill not keel me, I vill tell all I know. Monsieur Rocheblave,
de Gouverneur, he have two, t’ree, twenty t’ousand soldier
dere, and he march and make parade, eh, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu</i>, how
I know vat it mean—I be not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soldat</i>, I do not know, but dey
say de Americains dey come to cut our t’roats, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme les Indiens</i>,
and M. Rocheblave he say dat he <em>extair-r-rminate</em> dem for
King Shorge!”</p>

<p>“How many men are in the fort?” inquired one man, less
savage in aspect than the rest, and in good French.</p>

<p>“Not many, monsieur, not many. There is only the company
of Capitaine Ledoux to mount guard there,” said Picard,
glibly.</p>

<p>“Good!” said the other. “Where’s Adjutant Frank?”</p>

<p>It was Clark who spoke. There was a short silence.</p>

<p>Then Captain Harrod answered.</p>

<p>“I thought you knew, colonel. The little cuss found a
hoss yesterday, and rid off into the perrary, all alone, this arternoon.
He said as how he war a-goin’ on a scout on his
own hook.”</p>

<p>Clark seemed disturbed.</p>

<p>“I know, captain, I know; but I thought he had come
back. The boy promised to be with us by dark. Has any
one seen him since?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no answer, and Clark groaned aloud.</p>

<p>“The rash lad! He must have lost his way. If there
were any Indians about, I should judge him a prisoner; and
if he has been taken into Kaskaskia, the town will be alarmed,
and we shall have hard work!”</p>

<p>It was seldom the cautious leader allowed his feelings to
be publicly noticed, and it was evident he was deeply stirred
by the fate of the little adjutant, who had become a wonderful
favorite with all the command during the weary secret
march over the prairies of Illinois. He turned sternly on
Picard, saying:</p>

<p>“Now, sir, tell me quick, and tell me truly, as you value
your life, has the Governor of Kaskaskia any notion we are
here?”</p>

<p>“My God! monsieur, how can he? Should I be where I
am, if that were the case? I will tell the truth, monsieur.
The Governor expects you to come up the river, and men are
there, on the watch.”</p>

<p>“Then we waste time here,” said the leader, abruptly.
“Major Bowman, take your own company, with Harrod’s and
Helm’s. Cross in this man’s boat, and march on the town as
I told you. When you hear a gun from the fort, rush in
with a shout, take the place, and disarm every one. You
know the orders. Captain Montgomery’s company will follow
me. Place a guard over this house, and shoot any one
who tries to come out. Get in there!”</p>

<p>He signified his orders to the terrified Picards, who hurried
into the house, expecting nothing less than instant death.
The ignorant French were full of superstitious terrors about
the Americans, whom they had been taught to regard as merciless
savages; and Clark’s seeming brutality only confirmed
the impression.</p>

<p>Then there was a hurried embarkation by the riverside.</p>

<p>Honest Picard never dreamed that his flat-boat, which had
conveyed so many loads of cabbage to Kaskaskia, would
come one July night, to be a transport for ferocious enemies.
But it was even so, now. Loaded down to the water’s edge
with wild-looking backwoodsmen, it served as a ferry for the
three companies destined to attack the town, and, in less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
an hour after, the whole body was on its silent way to Kaskaskia.</p>

<p>At the moment of starting, Clark led the remaining company
down the river toward the fort, only about a half-mile below.
The men proceeded in Indian file, stealing along like
ghosts; and a person a hundred yards off could have suspected
nothing.</p>

<p>In a short time the gray bastions of the fort loomed up
before them, standing at the edge of a high bank, down
which one of its outworks stretched to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>The leader stayed his men with a signal and stole forward
himself to reconnoiter, when the sound of voices in gay
conversation struck his ear; and, the moment after, a little
postern door low down by the water, opened, and two men
came out and advanced toward the Americans as if careless
of danger.</p>

<p>Without an order given, every one of the invaders sunk
down to the earth in an instant and vanished from view,
leaving Clark alone in the middle of the open glacis.</p>

<p>The commander did not drop. He knew that he had been
seen, for the two men halted and seemed undecided whether
to advance or not.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of them called out in French:</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui vive?</i> (Who goes there?) Is it thou, Picard?”</p>

<p>Clark started violently. It was the voice of the missing
adjutant. With admirable presence of mind he imitated the
voice and rustic accent of the gardener, answering:</p>

<p>“It is I, indeed. Has the doctor gone back yet? My wife
is sick.”</p>

<p>“The doctor went back at sunset,” answered Frank, “but
here is Poirier, the hospital steward. He and I were coming
over to break a bottle with thee, Picard; but, since thy wife
is sick, Poirier shall do what he can.”</p>

<p>“Come on then, in God’s name,” said Clark, turning away
to aid the stratagem. “You have a lancet to let blood,
without doubt. Hasten, ere it be too late. She has fits.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Poirier,” cried the little adjutant; and the
hospital steward, completely deceived, hurried along after
Clark, until in the midst of the crouching borderers.</p>

<p>In another moment he was surrounded, and a dozen knives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
brandished at his throat, with a sternly whispered command
to keep silence, if he valued his life.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was so overcome with terror that he
dropped senseless in the road, and the little adjutant hurriedly
said:</p>

<p>“Into the fort, colonel, like lightning. The garrison sleep.
I’ll tell you how I fooled them when we’re safe. Not a moment
is to be lost. I’ll show the way.”</p>

<p>With the rapid, stealthy rush of so many tigers, Montgomery’s
company followed the flying figure to the fort,
swarmed in at the postern, took the sentries on the ramparts
without firing a shot, and in ten minutes were in full possession.</p>

<p>Then, with his own hand, Clark fired a six-pound shot
over the town, a signal answered by loud yells from the
opposite side of the river, as Bowman’s men rushed in like
a tempest through the deserted streets.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SURPRISE.</span></h2>


<p>Governor Rocheblave was roused from a dream, in
which he was being decorated with the Grand Cross of the
Bath for eminent services to his Britannic majesty, by the
sound of whoops, yells, and rifle-shots under his very house.
Then came the crash of glass and plaster, as several bullets
came through his window, and sent pieces of ceiling spattering
over the floor.</p>

<p>The Governor jumped out of bed, scared out of his wits,
and madame began to scream at the top of her voice, a
scream echoed from every quarter of the “palace,” as the
maid-servants heard the racket in the streets.</p>

<p>Then came the boom of four or five cannon, and a
louder crash than before, as the big chimney of the government
house, struck by a six-pound shot, toppled down
over the roof in a mass of ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a stillness perfectly awful succeeded for several
minutes, followed by the banging of opening windows, as
the terrified inhabitants began to look out.</p>

<p>As for Governor Rocheblave, he remembered the bullets
too well to dare go to his own windows; and presently came
the clatter of hoofs on the pavement below, as a horseman
pulled up from full speed. Then a stentorian voice bellowed,
in horribly bad French:</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fusillez tout homme dans la rue! Fermez fenetres!</i>”</p>

<p>But fear is a quick translator, and every one knew the
meaning of those words.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Shoot every man in the street! Shut windows!</span>”</p>

<p>A disinterested person would have admired the alacrity
with which the windows banged to, in obedience to the order;
but the people of Kaskaskia were too keenly alive to their
own perils to admire any thing.</p>

<p>In a moment Governor Rocheblave came to his senses, and
understood every thing. At first he had thought of an Indian
rising, but the cannon-shots and bad French convinced him
that a more formidable foe was at hand.</p>

<p>“Coralie, it is the barbarous Americans. What shall we
do?” he faltered, as he gazed, panic-stricken, at his wife.
“The papers—the agreements with the chiefs—they will find
them, and I shall be shot.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” said madame, more coolly. “I know these
men, if they are Americans. They are fools, where women
are concerned. Where are the papers?”</p>

<p>“In the box,” said the trembling Governor, pointing to a
casket of mahogany, open on the table.</p>

<p>In a moment the quick-witted woman pounced on the box,
bore it to her bed, and swept up the loose papers to the same
receptacle. She had hardly time to jump in after them when
a clatter of weapons was heard on the staircase, and a loud
knock was heard at the front door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” screamed madame, excitedly. “Are these
barbarians that insult the privacy of a lady’s chamber? Go
away!”</p>

<p>There was a short, whispered consultation outside, and a
voice spoke, in very bad French:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Open the door, Governor. We know you’re here. We
will not hurt the lady, but we must have the Governor.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Rocheblave has fled,” cried the lady, angrily, as
her husband, quaking with fear, turned up the light and moved
toward the door. “Have you no manners, pigs, that you do
not believe a lady? Go away!”</p>

<p>The only answer was a blow that burst the fastening of
the door, and into the room stalked Major Bowman, second in
command to Clark, who advanced to Rocheblave with a cocked
pistol in his hand, saying:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, you are my prisoner. Surrender your papers.”</p>

<p>Rocheblave sunk trembling into a chair.</p>

<p>“I surrender, monsieur. Spare my life, and pray do not
insult my wife, if you are gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“We <em>are</em> gentlemen,” said Bowman, quietly. “Madame is
safe; but you must dress and come with me to the commander.
No excuses, sir. I give you five minutes to dress.
Then you must come with us as you are. Where are your
papers?”</p>

<p>Rocheblave pointed to an open bureau, littered with the
more unimportant papers of his government, and the Kentuckian
advanced to inspect them, while the Governor finished
his dressing under the eye of a burly sergeant at the door,
whose rifle looked remarkably ready for action at a moment’s
notice.</p>

<p>But as the Governor found that he was quite unmolested,
his spirits began to recover from the first shock of surprise,
and he asked:</p>

<p>“Are you not going to give me my parole, sir? I suppose
that you make war like honorable soldiers.”</p>

<p>Bowman made no reply till he had made a hasty examination
of all the loose papers, finding nothing worthy of
note.</p>

<p>Then he turned round to Rocheblave, who was now
dressed:</p>

<p>“In five minutes, sir, my commander will be here. He can
answer your question. I find you have hidden your papers.”</p>

<p>Here madame, who had ducked under the bed-clothes, put
out her head to listen. There was considerable galloping to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and fro in the streets, and a great clattering, as if a party were
dismounting at the gate.</p>

<p>Rocheblave, who quickly saw that he had fallen into the
hands of organized troops, notwithstanding their rough exterior,
began to assume a more haughty tone, as became a
British officer.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean, sir,” he said, angrily. “You
have come into my house, like a parcel of rebel thieves, as
you are, and I have given up my papers. Are you not satisfied,
but do you wish to insult a prisoner?”</p>

<p>Madame, who had taken her cue, cried out:</p>

<p>“They want the silver, Auguste—that’s what they want,
these thieves. Show them the plate-chest, and you will hear
no more of papers. I know them well.”</p>

<p>Bowman, who was a chivalrous Kentucky gentleman, was
very much embarrassed by the lady’s bitter tongue, and was
greatly relieved by hearing the voice of his commander on the
stairs. He rose and retreated sheepishly to the door, while
madame exchanged a triumphant glance with her husband, and
fired a volley of spiteful sarcasms at the abashed soldier.</p>

<p>The next moment Clark entered the room, followed by the
boy adjutant.</p>

<p>A conference, in low tones, took place between the three
officers, at the end of which Clark advanced to the Governor.</p>

<p>The border leader, haggard and unshorn, with dirty, ragged
dress, was by no means a reassuring sight. The moment
madame laid eyes on him, she trembled for her papers.
While Clark was speaking to the Governor, the little adjutant,
whose face had been blacked all over, so that he looked
worse than his leader, went peering about the room in a
manner very different from that of his restrained and dignified
chiefs.</p>

<p>“Governor,” said Clark, “Major Bowman tells me you
have hidden all the valuable papers of your office. Where
are they? Give them up, and I give you your parole. Refuse,
and I put a guard over you.”</p>

<p>“Who are you, sir?” asked Rocheblave, sulkily.</p>

<p>“I am Colonel Clark of Kentucky,” said the other. “I
have taken your town, and your people are being disarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
as fast as my men can pile the weapons. Where are your
papers?”</p>

<p>“I know, colonel,” said the quiet voice of Adjutant Frank.
As he spoke he pointed to madame, who sat up in the bed,
guarding her treasures. The lady screamed indignantly.</p>

<p>“Wretches, barbarians, do you bring boys with you to insult
ladies? The Governor has no papers. I swear it. These
are but my private jewels and trinkets, and let me see a man
dare to touch them.”</p>

<p>Little Frank was actually approaching the lady, to take
the papers his sharp eyes had discovered, when the deep
voice of Clark broke in:</p>

<p>“Hold, Mr. Frank. Better that she should hide any
amount of papers, than that a gentleman should insult a
lady. Governor, you’re a close prisoner till I see those papers.
Gentlemen, clear the room. To our other duties.”</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE ALGONQUIN VENUS.</span></h2>


<p>At a late hour next day Kaskaskia presented a strange
sight. Not a single house was open, every window and door
was closely fastened, the very beasts remained bolted in
their stables, and a grim-looking patrol of mounted borderers
rode up and down the echoing streets, with cocked rifles.</p>

<p>A town of fifteen hundred inhabitants was trembling with
abject terror before a force of some two hundred resolute
men, who had captured it without shedding a drop of blood,
by the pure moral influence of fear.</p>

<p>The main body of the invaders lay at the edge of the town,
by their bivouac fires, which burned brightly at the expense
of all the neighboring fences. There was bluff Simon Kenton,
who had left his old friend Boone in Kentucky, to share
the perils and glories of the Kaskaskia expedition, and who
was lolling on his back, laughing over the night’s adventures
to a group of borderers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Golly, Bill,” said he, to Harrod, who was devouring a
huge chunk of corn-bread with great relish, “how them
French Britishers do skeer, to <em>be</em> sure! I b’lieve ef we’d
axed them fur all thar money last night, instead of their
shootin’-irons, they’d ’a’ guv it jest as easy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you b’lieve it, Sime,” said Harrod, dryly. “It
takes a powerful skeer to git a feller’s money. But, Gosh,
boys, that thar little cuss of a adjutant of ours, he did fly
round amazin’ last night. Jest like a bug on a hot griddle,
he war. And ef it hadn’t b’en fur him, Lord knows ef we’d
’a’ tuk the fort at all.”</p>

<p>“Who is that adjutant?” inquired Major Bowman, who
was sitting close by them, in republican simplicity, guiltless
of military etiquette when off duty. “I never saw him
in Kentucky; but he seems to be a great favorite with
Clark.”</p>

<p>“He’s some relation of Governor Henry’s,” said Captain
Helm, a stout, jolly, red-faced officer from Virginia. “Clark
told me he brought a letter from Henry to him, which asked
him, as a personal favor, to make Frank his adjutant. The
colonel hesitated, on account of the lad’s being so young, but
I must say, gentlemen, I don’t ever remember seeing a smarter
officer of his inches.”</p>

<p>“Thar’s the little cuss now,” cried Harrod, laughing, as
the little officer rode out of a by street and came up to the
bivouac. “I tell <em>you</em>, gentlemen, he are gritty, if he are
small. Don’t he sit his hoss pritty? Gosh, if he war only
a gal, wouldn’t he make a reg’lar ringtailed snorter! I c’u’d
hug him myself.”</p>

<p>“He are pretty ’nuff fur a gal, that’s as true as Gospel,
boys,” said Kenton, meditatively. “But, no gal c’u’d dash
around the way he does; and he’s got the grit of a dozen
wildcats.”</p>

<p>Here little Frank galloped up, on a very handsome mustang,
which he rode in among the recumbent borderers with
delicious coolness, causing them to tumble out of the way in
a terrible hurry.</p>

<p>Had any one else in the command done such a thing, he
would have been plucked off his animal and soundly beaten
in a twinkling; but the little adjutant and his pony were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
general favorites, and seemed able to go anywhere, without
offense.</p>

<p>“Well, Bowman,” cried the youngster, gayly, “your men
are not good for much to search for arms, after all. Here’s
a building, not fifty feet from your bivouac, with twelve Indians
in it, every man fully armed and in his war-paint.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, Frank,” said the major, disbelieving him;
“how could that be, and we not know it?”</p>

<p>“Ah, major, you’re not supposed to know every thing,”
said the boy, saucily. “I heard all about it last night, but I
didn’t want our stupid-heads to know it; for you couldn’t
disarm those fellows in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Are you serious, Frank?”</p>

<p>“Never more so.”</p>

<p>The adjutant pointed to a large building near the government
house, the identical one in which Ruby Roland and her
red escort had been quartered the night before. The doors
and windows were shut, and there was no appearance that
the place was tenanted.</p>

<p>“There they are,” said the boy; “and with them a great
Indian princess, who came to the Governor with a message
from Tobacco, head chief and Grand Door of the Wabash.
I heard all about it last night, when I was spying about the
town.”</p>

<p>“How did you get in, adjutant?” asked Helm, curiously.
“You’re not a Frenchman, are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m a little of every thing,” said the boy, laughing. “At
all events, I can talk French well enough to fool a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitan</i>.
And I can fool an Indian, too. What will you bet I don’t
send the whole lot, princess and all, out of that building, before
your eyes, in twenty minutes?”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars, even, you don’t,” said Helm, eagerly.
He was a skilled Indian-trader and interpreter, himself, and
thought he knew all about Indians.</p>

<p>“Done!” said Frank, promptly.</p>

<p>He rode up the steps of the house he had indicated, and
knocked loudly at the door with the butt of a pistol.</p>

<p>Immediately it was flung open, and a stately Indian chief,
in scarlet blanket, was revealed to the doubting gaze of the
officers. As coolly as if doing a commonplace thing, the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
adjutant rode straight into the house, the door clanged to,
and all was again still and silent.</p>

<p>“Wal,” exclaimed Kenton, rubbing his eyes, “that ’ar little
cuss do beat the deuce, I sw’ar. How did he know them
Injuns was thar?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, some of the townspeople told him,” said
Helm, in a snappish tone. “Perhaps the Governor let it out
to Clark. I suppose these fellows are there on some embassy.
I wonder where the colonel is?”</p>

<p>“Quartered at Rocheblave’s,” said Bowman. “What do
you want?”</p>

<p>“I want to know what we ought to do about these savages,”
said Helm. “They may murder that boy, in there, and
it’s not safe to leave them the way they’re left now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, Helm; that youngster’s able to take care
of himself. You’re bound to wait your twenty minutes, you
know, on account of your bet.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he doesn’t come out then, I’m going in after him,”
said Helm, firmly. “I fear the lad’s run into a trap.”</p>

<p>“All right, when the time’s up,” said Bowman; “but I
don’t believe that boy’s born to be murdered.”</p>

<p>They continued gazing at the mysterious building in deep
doubt for some time, till, just as Helm’s patience was exhausted,
the big door flew open once more, and forth rode, in
all the splendor of an Indian princess, Ruby Roland, bewildering
in her beauty, and, wheeling her horse sharp round to
the right, galloped off up the street, followed by her retinue
of chiefs, among whom the little adjutant could be seen, with
a tall chief on each side of him, as the cavalcade dashed out
of the hall and down the steps, all mounted as they were, like
a whirlwind. Up the street they went, toward the government
house, ere Helm had fully recovered from his amazement.</p>

<p>Then the party could be seen dismounting and entering the
government house, when Bowman said:</p>

<p>“By Jove, gentlemen, one thing’s certain. Frank’s found
an angel for us. That girl is a perfect Algonquin Venus.”</p>

<p>And plain Captain Bill Harrod said:</p>

<p>“Gosh, Bowman, don’t be flingin’ dictionaries at us. What
in Old Scratch is a Algonquin Venus?”</p>

<p>Says Simon Kenton:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s Latin for a nice little gal, sweet as maple-syrup.
And by Gosh, boys, I’d give a hull farm to hug that gal.”</p>

<p>To which Bill elegantly replied:</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t look at sich a ornary cuss as you. Go ’way,
Sime. She don’t know you.”</p>

<p>Simon jumped up excitedly.</p>

<p>“And by Gosh, I’ll bet my rifle ag’in’ your’n that I know
her, and that she knows me. That gal’s Ruby Roland, darter
of old Tobacco; and you may jist bet she knows me and
Cunnel Boone like a book, you ornary squirrel-picker. So
thar.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">RUBY’S VISIT.</span></h2>


<p>Colonel Clark was seated in the great drawing-room of
the government house, with Rocheblave near him, a sentry at
the open door, and one of the principal inhabitants standing
in an humble attitude before him. Clark’s face was stern
and cold, for he was yet playing a part, and desired to frighten
the people of Kaskaskia to the utmost.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he said, sternly, “and so you will not confess
who is the principal instigator of these Indian atrocities?
Beware, for I can order you out to be shot in one
minute.”</p>

<p>“And if you shoot me ten times over, monsieur,” said the
other, in a shaking voice, “I could tell no more. I am but
a poor dealer in snuff and tobacco, and know nothing of Indian
plots. Ask Monsieur Rocheblave. He knows all.
There was an Indian embassy came to him only yesterday
evening.”</p>

<p>Rocheblave, at the first mention of his name, had been
signaling the other to keep quiet, but in vain.</p>

<p>“No, you need not wink at me, monsieur; I shall tell the
American General all I know. I will not be shot to please
you. There were twelve chiefs from the Wabash, monsieur,
with Mademoiselle Rubie, the daughter of the Grand Door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and they were quartered in the old arsenal for the night, if
they have not escaped.”</p>

<p>Clark turned grimly on Rocheblave.</p>

<p>“Why did I not know this, sir?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, monsieur le colonel, I meant no harm,” said
Rocheblave, hastily; “and, indeed, these fellows are only
friends of a cousin of my wife’s, Mademoiselle Rubie
Roland.”</p>

<p>“Ruby Roland,” repeated Clark, slowly; “is that the
adopted daughter of old Tabac?”</p>

<p>“The same, monsieur,” said the snuff-merchant, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Then, if she is here, I am glad,” said Clark, quietly.
“You can go back home, sir; but do not stop to speak to a
soul. The patrol has orders to shoot any citizen standing still
in the streets. Go, and remember.”</p>

<p>The snuff-merchant bowed down to the very ground, and
backed from the room, just as a tremendous clatter of hoofs
outside announced the arrival of Ruby Roland and her
cavalcade.</p>

<p>Clark hurried to the window, somewhat startled, and beheld
the twelve stalwart Indians and the girl springing off
their horses.</p>

<p>The sight of his boy adjutant’s uniform among them reassured
him of their intentions, for Clark had grown to feel
almost a superstitious confidence in this reckless lad.</p>

<p>He returned to his seat, then, with measured steps, for he
knew the importance of preserving dignity before the stately
Indians. With perfect patience he remained sitting, waiting
for his new guests, while Rocheblave, who felt his position
keenly, fidgeted about uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the sentry at the door challenged, as
the sound of moccasined feet approached.</p>

<p>“Let them pass, sentry,” said Clark, quietly; and into the
room swept Ruby Roland, in a perfect blaze of splendor, followed
by her dusky escort.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Clark rose, and bowed with the deepest respect
to the beautiful creature. It seemed to him as if he
beheld her for the first time.</p>

<p>It was not quite true, as he had told Frank, that Ruby had
failed to leave any impression on his mind the year before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
when he had seen her under the disadvantages of fatigue
and hunger, which had reduced her features to gauntness.
Still, his own mind had been so much preoccupied at the time
with his Kaskaskia scheme, that he apparently noticed little
else.</p>

<p>Now, however, in the moment of his triumph, when this
beautiful girl approached him, dressed like a princess, the
bold leader, for the first time in his life, felt a curious
throbbing at his heart, as he bowed before her to the very
ground, at least as deep as the obsequious snuff-merchant.</p>

<p>To his surprise, Ruby returned the courtesy with the very
least inclination of the head, then turned and addressed a few
words to her retinue, who gravely seated themselves in a line
on the floor, in front of the door.</p>

<p>Then the girl advanced to Rocheblave, who stood undecided
what to do, and gravely embraced him in the French
fashion.</p>

<p>“My cousin,” she said, “I have heard of your misfortune.
Why did you not listen to my words? I warned you that
the door would be shut; but you see I have come, as I
promised.”</p>

<p>“You might as well have stayed away,” said the ex-Governor,
sulkily. “You must have known these people were
coming, and would not warn your old allies.”</p>

<p>“Our old ally was my father’s king,” said Ruby, proudly;
“and it was to please him that I did not betray the Big-Knives.
I have been with them on their march when they
knew not, and my warriors have watched every step they
took. Where were your senses, that you only watched the
river? The road over the prairie from Fort Massac is
straight. A child could follow it to Kaskaskia.”</p>

<p>“Spare me your sneers, mademoiselle,” said Rocheblave,
not without dignity; “there is my captor, if you wish to
turn to the rising sun. I can entertain no further proposals,
for I am a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“I did not come here to reproach you, my cousin,” said
Ruby, gently; “but for a kinder purpose by far. I will
open the door again, if you will enter. See now, you were
born a Frenchman, and the French king owned all this place.
Now France and America are allies, and I call to you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
return to your old allegiance; desert this sour-faced British
nation, and be a gay friend of America as I am.”</p>

<p>“Never,” exclaimed Rocheblave, angrily—“never will I
submit to be called a friend of these accursed rebel hounds.
Let them do their worst. I have eaten the king’s bread, and
I will never desert him. Go, tempt Coralie, if you like. I
will not yield.”</p>

<p>“And where is Coralie?” asked Ruby, with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>“In her chamber, which the rebel dogs dare not profane,”
said the Governor, loftily. “Even there they had the insolence
to penetrate last night.”</p>

<p>“They found but little, I venture to say,” answered Ruby.
“I know Coralie too well to doubt her ability to hoodwink
these men of Kentucky, who—between us, cousin—are easily
blinded by a fine woman. By this time, I doubt not that the
agreements with Blackfish and the Chickasaw chiefs are
burnt. How much do you pay for white scalps this year,
cousin?”</p>

<p>Clark had been a silent and interested listener to this brief
colloquy, and he noticed that the Governor turned deadly pale
at the home-thrust of the girl. Now he advanced himself
and spoke to Ruby.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” he said, “I may possibly have passed out
of your remembrance, but I have not forgotten the lady who
came through such perils to Harrodsburg, to propose to me
the alliance of the tribes of the Wabash. Whatever papers
Madame Rocheblave may destroy, mademoiselle, it were better
she should do it than that we should insult a lady. That is
a point of honor with us rough Kentuckians.”</p>

<p>Ruby looked at him critically, and unconsciously Clark
turned crimson under the glance. It seemed to him that he
had never before seemed so dirty and unkempt in his life, as
when he stood before this brilliant beauty, in his ragged campaign
uniform, with his unshaven face.</p>

<p>“You Kentuckians have more mercy than we women,” she
said. “I would have got those papers for you. But you
Americans are easily worked on by a pretty face. I remember
once when you were not so polite as now. You were
rude to me, monsieur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>And Clark, greatly confused, stammered that he “did not
quite remember to what she referred,” as the straightforward
beauty fixed him with her great dark eyes.</p>

<p>“I know,” she said. “I have a good memory, monsieur,
and, if I have a mind, I can overturn all your fine expedition
in the moment of success. Be polite now, for you will
find that one year has made a great difference with Ruby
Roland.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE CURE’S EMBASSY.</span></h2>


<p>Clark was about to answer deprecatingly, when the voice
of the sentry at the lower door was heard challenging:</p>

<p>“Halt! you kurn’t pass here, mounseer. Colonel’s quarters.”</p>

<p>“But if I wish to see the colonel, my friend,” said a mild
voice, “can not I go in? I am the parish priest, father
Gibault.”</p>

<p>“Kurn’t help it,” said the sentry, sturdily. “My orders is
to let no one pass. Sergeant give me a shakin’ up about lettin’
in them ’ere Injins, jest now.”</p>

<p>“But my dear friend,” said the priest, mildly, “I do but
wish to ask permission to wait on the commander, with five
of the oldest inhabitants of the town, to represent to him our
cruel position.”</p>

<p>Clark, who had been listening intently to this dialogue, now
spoke to the sentry at his own door.</p>

<p>“Sentry, is the adjutant outside? Call him in.”</p>

<p>“Please, colonel, the adjutant bean’t hyar,” said the
man.</p>

<p>“Not here,” said Clark, surprised. “Why I saw him at the
door. Where is he?”</p>

<p>Ruby Roland answered him:</p>

<p>“Your adjutant is a great friend of mine, colonel, and has
gone on a message for me. In his absence, allow me to act
for him, as I am responsible for his reappearance. What do
you wish done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish—but, mademoiselle, I could not think of giving
you so much trouble.”</p>

<p>“I prefer it, colonel. You wish to send a message?”</p>

<p>“I wish to inform the gentleman below that I will receive
him and his friends in half an hour; and I want to see all
my officers here.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done, monsieur,” said the girl, quietly.</p>

<p>Then she turned to her grim escort, and spoke to them in
their own tongue a few words. Every chief sprung up, saluted
Clark with great gravity, and followed Ruby from the
room.</p>

<p>Clark went to the window, and looked down. He saw an
old man in a priest’s cassock, waiting by the gate; and very
soon saw Ruby and the Indians come out and speak to him.
Then the priest turned away, Ruby and the Indians mounted,
rode down the streets toward the American camp, and all
was still again.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after, Bowman, Harrod, and the principal officers,
rode up to the door, and came up-stairs, when Clark
dismissed the Governor, under guard, to his wife’s room, and
awaited the return of the priest and his party.</p>

<p>Inquiring what had become of Ruby and the Indians, the
leader was told that they had re-entered the arsenal and disappeared.
The time passed in discussing their plans for the
future; and then, punctually to the half-hour, they heard a
horseman pull up outside, and the gay voice of the little adjutant,
singing an old French hunting-song, as he came up stairs.</p>

<p>Then the small officer tripped into the room, saluted gayly,
and said:</p>

<p>“Colonel, that little squaw princess detained me unwarrantably,
but you know a Kentuckian must obey the ladies. There
are a lot of gray-headed old gentlemen coming up the street,
and I think they look like a deputation.”</p>

<p>Clark looked at the boy severely. Somehow he didn’t like
the familiar way in which the latter spoke of Ruby.</p>

<p>“Young gentleman,” he said, “when you have more sense,
you will esteem it an honor to wait on a lady, especially one
so beautiful and modest as mademoiselle. Speak of her with
proper respect, sir. She is no squaw.”</p>

<p>“I cry you mercy, colonel,” quoth the saucy lad. “I forgot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that you had just seen her. You know you told me once
you would not know her again. How is it now?”</p>

<p>“I should know her among a million,” said Clark,
warmly.</p>

<p>The little adjutant burst out laughing, in defiance of all
military etiquette.</p>

<p>“’Gad, gentlemen, I fear the colonel’s smitten to the heart,”
he cried. “The invulnerable colonel’s fallen in love with this
dusky princess; and he’s ready to cut any man’s throat that
says a word against her.”</p>

<p>The other officers, rough backwoodsmen all, save Bowman
and Montgomery, used only to republican equality, made no
scruple of joining in the laugh. Clark turned white with
anger, and his voice was deep with concentrated rage, as he
said:</p>

<p>“Adjutant Frank, go to your quarters under arrest. Gentlemen,
the man that persists in this unseemly merriment becomes
my enemy at any hazard. Do I command this expedition
or not?”</p>

<p>In a moment there was a dead silence, broken only by
Frank. Contrary to his usual custom, the boy seemed possessed
with a perfect devil of impudence that day.</p>

<p>“All right, colonel,” he said, gayly. “The quarters are with
the young lady at present. We’ll see what she says, when
she hears that you vented the rage on your junior officer that
you did not dare to show to her, or an equal.”</p>

<p>In a moment Clark strode forward to where the audacious
officer stood, with a look of concentrated fury on his face.
The backwoods leader possessed a furious temper, which he
generally controlled only by exercise of an iron will. For a
moment every one in the room thought that he was about to
strike the boy down, and big Bill Harrod half-stepped forward
to lay hands on his commander.</p>

<p>But, ere the big captain reached him, Clark had controlled
his passion by a mighty effort, and spoke in a low, hoarse
tone:</p>

<p>“Boy, while this expedition lasts, I command here. When
it is over, I’ll give you satisfaction on equal terms. Think
yourself lucky that I do not strangle you here. It is but
your weakness protects you now. But do not dare again to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
breathe one word of disrespect toward the lady whom I saw
this morning, or I will not answer for my forbearance. I
have business. Go.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the door with a trembling finger, his face
ashy pale, his eyes glittering dangerously. The little adjutant
saluted, gravely, and went to the door.</p>

<p>At the door he turned and said, in a tone of indescribable
insolency:</p>

<p>“What a coil, gentlemen, about a little squaw!”</p>

<p>Big Bill Harrod rushed at him with a stifled guffaw, and
hustled him off, growling:</p>

<p>“You tarnation sarcy little cuss, d’yer want ter get killed?
Cunnel’s madder than twenty wildcats now.”</p>

<p>And indeed the good-natured borderer’s action was the only
thing that brought Clark to his senses, for the exasperated
chief had already half drawn his sword.</p>

<p>But as Harrod carried the boy down-stairs, the other officers
gathered round Clark, expostulating, and Kenton remarked:</p>

<p>“Cunnel, the little cuss hev gone crazy, you may bet. He
never acted so afore, and it’s b’en a tearin’ hot day. I suspicion
he’s b’en sun-struck.”</p>

<p>“Drunk, more likely,” said Helm, in a tone of contempt.
“Those boys are not fit to trust with a bottle of applejack.
They go cracked in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Let it pass, gentlemen,” said Clark, impatiently. “Remember
we have business to do, and this priest and his
friends are at the gate by this time. I’ll attend to that
boy in due time. Now get ready to receive this deputation.”</p>

<p>They settled themselves in chairs round the room, and soon
Bill Harrod lumbered in, escorting father Gibault and five
venerable citizens, who trembled as if their last hour had
come, and remained near the door, bowing confusedly, and
looking among the ragged, dirty figures before them as if doubting
the evidence of their senses.</p>

<p>At last the priest faltered out to Harrod:</p>

<p>“Please, good monsieur, will you not tell me which of
these honorable gentlemen is your leader?”</p>

<p>“That thar man in the big cheer, with the laced hat,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Harrod, pointing with his thumb at Clark, whose battered
head-covering had once been laced. “Spit out what you’ve
got to say, lively.”</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE LAST MASS.</span></h2>


<p>The poor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</i> looked from one to the other, as if doubting
whether they were not playing a cruel practical joke on
him. The faces of all the officers had been blackened in
streaks with gunpowder and water, in a fashion which many
of the grimly-humorous backwoodsmen had taken from the
Indian war-paint. In dress they were no way superior to
their men, and the wearing of swords was all that distinguished
them. Such a looking set of ruffians might have
frightened any one, much more the poor Frenchmen, whose
minds had been industriously filled with horrible stories about
the “rebels” by Hamilton’s and Rocheblave’s emissaries.</p>

<p>Clark, whose pity was excited by the evident terror of
these feeble old men, came forward kindly enough, and
said:</p>

<p>“I am Colonel Clark, of Kentucky, gentlemen, commander
of this force. What is your business? Fear nothing. We
will not kill you. Speak freely.”</p>

<p>Father Gibault, who seemed to be spokesman, was so much
affected by the kind tone, that he faltered:</p>

<p>“God bless you, monsieur! God bless you! You are very
kind, and we are very old.”</p>

<p>Clark waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, well, gentlemen, what is your business? Speak
quickly, for I am busy.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said the priest, earnestly, “we are well aware
that your people do not belong to our church, and that you
hold its doctrines in derision; but, monsieur, we beg leave to
assure you that we are very quiet, harmless people. We
know that the fortune of war has thrown us into your hands,
and that we must expect to be separated from our happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
homes, perhaps never to meet again. But, oh, monsieur, we
beg, in the name of humanity, that you will allow us to meet
once more, for the last time in our church, to hear one last
mass, and to take leave of each other.”</p>

<p>And the five old men, with one accord, broke out weeping
in the most piteous manner, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, monsieur, for the love of God!” “Pity us!” “Indeed
we did not know who you were.” “The commandant
told us you were all savages.” “But we know better now.”</p>

<p>As if by one consent, the rough backwoodsmen jumped up
and stamped away to the windows, while muttered exclamations
of sympathy were heard.</p>

<p>Clark waved his hand for silence, for he had his face under
more control than his subordinates, though he too was much
affected by the spectacle of old men in tears.</p>

<p>Then he said, in a careless tone:</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say against your church, gentlemen.
That is a matter we Americans leave every man to settle with
his God. If your people wish to assemble in the church, they
can do so; but at the same time, if they do, they must not
venture out of town. I will withdraw the troops to let you
assemble. Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks, monsieur, thanks!” cried father Gibault, in
a tone of great relief. “But, oh, monsieur, if you would only
listen to us for a little while, I feel confident that we could
convince you that our intentions have always been of the
most innocent—”</p>

<p>“That will do,” said the colonel, sternly. “I have listened
to you long enough, gentlemen. I have no leisure for
further intercourse. The officer of the day will withdraw
the men from the town and you can meet at the church.
Good-day.”</p>

<p>He saluted stiffly, and turned away, while the overawed
group of delegates left the room in mournful silence, the terror
being at its utmost hight.</p>

<p>When they were fairly in the street, Clark turned to his
officers, who stood silently round, and said, solemnly:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, pray God that when this war is over we may
never have another. This is a bad business, and were it not
that I intend to change the mourning of these poor creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to joy before to-morrow, I swear to you that I would march
back to Kentucky to-night. No, I wouldn’t neither; but I
hate to be looked on as a wild beast. Bowman, keep the
men out of the houses, as soon as the people go to the
church. I swear I feel sick at heart.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was nearly sunset before the people separated from the
church. The windows were wide open, for it was still very
hot and sultry, and the whole force of the Americans was
drawn up near by, resting silently on their arms, auditors of
all that passed and very respectful auditors.</p>

<p>They could hear the solemn voice of the old priest, chanting
mass, the responses of the congregation broken by sobs
and tears. Then several of the older inhabitants made long
and pathetic speeches, urging to resignation under the will
of Heaven, while women and children cried, and men groaned
aloud.</p>

<p>And, outside of the church, the supposed barbarians,
whom the terrified people within looked on as little better
than their fierce Indian neighbors, were hushed in pitying silence,
while some of the roughest broke down and blubbered
secretly.</p>

<p>At last there was a deep hush, within and without, as the
priest, with faltering voice pronounced the benediction, and
a stir, that followed, announced that the people were coming
out.</p>

<p>Suddenly Clark, who had been standing, gloomily leaning
on his sword, started.</p>

<p>“Attention!” he shouted, sternly. “Stand to your arms
there, men! Who gave you leave to fall out? Shoulder
arms! Support arms! Silence in the ranks! Officers to
your posts!”</p>

<p>Then, as the door opened, and father Gibault came out
with a few of the principal inhabitants, they were met by
the sight of a grim line of brown rifle-barrels, as the savage-looking
frontiersmen obeyed their chief’s orders.</p>

<p>Clark, with drawn sword, stood rigidly in front of his men,
looking at the priest, as the latter solemnly advanced with
his little deputation, while the church door was full of pale,
anxious people, afraid to advance a step further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Gibault advanced to Clark, and said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur le colonel, to you and your brave comrades, I
beg leave to offer, in the name of my flock, our deep gratitude
for the indulgence we have received. Whether we live
or die, we shall always remember and bless you for this kindness.
And now, monsieur, at the prayer of my children, I
beg leave to address you, our conqueror, on a subject dearer
to us than any other. Monsieur, may I speak, before all?”</p>

<p>A pin might have been heard to drop as Clark said,
briefly:</p>

<p>“Speak on, father.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said the good old priest, clasping his hands,
and with the tears streaming down his cheeks, as he spoke
with impassioned earnestness, “we are sensible that our present
situation is the fate of war, cruel merciless war. Monsieur,
we are all ready to submit, to the loss of our property.
But oh, monsieur, we beg only one thing. I beg for my
poor children that they may not be separated from their
wives and tender little ones. Our property and lives are
yours, but, for the love of the good God, dear monsieur,
spare us the sight of those little ones torn from us to starve,
and if you must take us away for slaves, do not separate our
families. If you have the further mercy to allow us some clothes
and provisions for our support during the terrible journey
before us, monsieur, God will bless you for it, and we shall
never forget the indulgence.”</p>

<p>The old man paused a moment amid a breathless silence
to look into the face of Clark. It was set into a stern frown,
and the leader had his teeth dug into his under lip. But,
not a sign of pity made its appearance on his pale countenance,
and his eyes were glaring at the priest, as if the Kentuckian
were in a perfect fury.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” continued father Gibault, in a trembling tone,
“I assure you that the conduct of our people during this war
has been influenced by our commandants, whom we were always
taught to obey. I am not sure, monsieur, that any of
us, at this moment, clearly understand the cause of dispute
between your own honorable country and his majesty of
England. All that we know we have been told by our
Governors, and as you are aware, dear good monsieur, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
are but few opportunities, in these remote regions, of acquiring
accurate information. Indeed, monsieur, with all our
commandant’s stories to mislead and deceive us, there are
very many among us, who have expressed themselves
friendly to the gallant Americans, as much as they durst under
the eyes of the Governor’s spies. Oh, monsieur, dear
good monsieur, you must have a kind heart hidden beneath
that rough frock. In the name of God whom I serve, spare
my flock the cruelty of separation, have pity on their wives
and little tender babes, and do not turn them out to starve.”</p>

<p>As the priest spoke he fell on his knees, and with him the
whole deputation, while a wailing sob went up from the
church-door, whence every word was distinctly audible.</p>

<p>The sob was echoed all along the rigid line of Americans,
and you could see the muskets shake, while a hoarse murmur
of sympathy rolled along the line.</p>

<p>Clark turned abruptly away, stamped his foot violently,
and dashed the point of his sword into the earth, as if in a
terrible passion.</p>

<p>“Silence in the ranks, you soft-headed fools!” he shouted.
“Do you think George Rogers Clark does not know his own
business?”</p>

<p>Then turning on the trembling Frenchmen, he cried
fiercely:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, do you mistake us for savages? I am almost
certain you do from your language. Do you think that we
Americans intend to strip women and children, or take the
bread out of their mouths? My countrymen, gentlemen,
disdain to make war upon helpless innocence. It was to
prevent the horrors of Indian butchery upon our own wives
and children, that we have taken arms and penetrated into
this remote stronghold of British and Indian barbarity, and
not for the despicable prospect of plunder. Now that the
King of France has united his powerful arms with those of
America, the war will not in all probability last long; but
the inhabitants of Kaskaskia are at liberty to take which side
they please, without the least danger to their property and
families. Nor will your religion be any source of disagreement,
as all religions are regarded with equal respect in the
eye of the American law, and any insult to it shall be punished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
immediately. And now to prove my sincerity, please
inform your fellow-citizens that they are quite at liberty to
conduct themselves as usual, without the least apprehension.
I am now convinced, from what I have learned since my arrival
among you, that you have been misinformed and prejudiced
against us by British officers; and all your friends that
are in confinement shall immediately be released.”</p>

<p>And the unmasked stoic, who had played his part of tyrant
with so much imposing fierceness, broke down at last,
and shook hands with the agitated old men, the tears streaming
down his face.</p>

<p>A mighty cheer broke from the borderers, and in a moment,
all discipline disappeared, as French and Americans
fraternized in a grand burst of joy.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE LAMPOON.</span></h2>


<p>At an early hour on a day of the following week, all
Kaskaskia was astir. Great changes had taken place during
that week. The undeceived citizens had found out the true
nature of their invaders, and had not only welcomed them,
but had taken the oath of allegiance to the United States
Government, and become its warmest friends.</p>

<p>Not only that, but they had actually assisted them by force
of arms to complete that surprising conquest of Illinois, which
was made without the effusion of a drop of blood. When
Clark dispatched Major Bowman with half his force, to reduce
Cahokia, an important trading-station higher up the river,
the major was accompanied by two bodies of French militia,
with restored arms, who were the first to enter the place
and inform the astounded inhabitants of the change of masters.
The enterprise was completely successful, the fort at
Cahokia was garrisoned with Americans, and the conquest of
Illinois was virtually over.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, Clark was able to turn his attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to pacifying and regulating his suddenly acquired conquests,
and toward the question of reducing the second of the
great chain of posts from the lakes to the Mississippi, St. Vincent’s.</p>

<p>The Indian chiefs from the Wabash, with their beautiful
princess, were also constantly in his thoughts; and almost
every day a grand council was held, at which were settled the
preliminaries of those treaties which were to secure Kentucky
from savage barbarity.</p>

<p>In all these councils, Ruby Roland acted as interpreter and
chief at once of her dusky delegation, and the intercourse between
her and the American leader was constant and quite
familiar. The girl invariably insisted on the presence of
father Gibault, who had become an ardent ally of the Americans,
and the counsels of the two were of the utmost use to
Clark, in the novel position in which he found himself
placed.</p>

<p>And all this while the backwoods leader, who had been at
the very first struck by Ruby’s beauty, found himself falling
quickly and surely into the meshes of a love-net, from which
it was impossible to extricate himself.</p>

<p>Ruby, whose manner toward him had been cold and distant
at first, had retained her coldness, varied by bursts of
great apparent friendliness, in public.</p>

<p>But on one or two occasions, when Clark had endeavored,
at the close of business, to engage her in conversation, she
had invariably repelled him with the utmost haughtiness.
While father Gibault was present, she would talk freely, displaying
all the graces of a cultivated woman; but to Clark
alone she was as cold and cutting as a north-west wind.</p>

<p>Ruby Roland was indeed a strange compound of civilization
and barbarism. Father Gibault himself, who had given
her the greater part of her education, was often puzzled at
her moods. The Indian warrior and the polished lady were
about equally mixed in her manner. Of the humble, submissive
squaw there was no trace, for dignity and pride were in
every motion.</p>

<p>At last Clark grew desperate. It was at the end of the
last council, on the day when Bowman returned from Cahokia,
when a final treaty of peace and amity had been concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
between the tribes of the Wabash on the one hand, and
the Americans on the other. When the chiefs rose to depart,
after shaking hands with the colonel, Clark laid his hand on
Ruby’s arm, as she was about to follow them, and said, in a
clear voice:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Roland, with the chief’s daughter my business
is over. With the French lady I desire a few minutes’
conversation.”</p>

<p>Ruby looked at him from head to foot as she withdrew
her arm from his touch.</p>

<p>“You can not be much acquainted with French customs,
monsieur,” she said, icily, “if you are not aware that unmarried
girls do not hold conversation with bachelors, alone.”</p>

<p>“I invite father Gibault to be present,” said the Kentuckian,
steadily determined not to be beaten. “There can be no impropriety
in our talking before your religious instructor.”</p>

<p>Ruby smiled very provokingly.</p>

<p>“There may be no impropriety, sir, but you will please to
note that I belong to the delegation with which I came, and as
a chief of the Wabash I have a duty to my friends. I can not
leave them. So I wish you good morning.”</p>

<p>“Stay, madam,” cried Clark, excitedly. “In heaven’s
name, how am I to take you? Are you chief or lady? Keep
to one character, I beseech you. Which is it to be?”</p>

<p>Ruby drew her little figure up, and threw her velvet mantle
over one shoulder, Indian fashion, with an air of the most
ineffable pride.</p>

<p>“It is to be any thing, monsieur, which will keep me from
speaking to you, who have avenged yourself on a poor boy
for the cruelties you dare not resent from me.”</p>

<p>And she was at the door ere Clark had recovered from his
astonishment. Then he rushed forward, crying:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, only one single word. If I forgive the
adjutant, will you grant me one single interview?”</p>

<p>“Try it, and see,” was the unsatisfactory reply, as the girl
stepped haughtily from the room.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Helas, mon ami</i>, it is no use,” said father Gibault, elevating
his shoulders to his ears in a truly French shrug. “You
can not drive that child from her own way. I remember
when she was little, before her father died—rest his soul, poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Captain Roland—she would roam away alone among the Indians,
and they were more dangerous then than now. She
would go up to the grimmest warrior in his war-paint, and
pull his scalp-lock as he sat by the fire; and ’twas her wonderful
boldness that first gained her the love of the old chief,
Tabac. She was made a chief before she was ten years old,
and formally adopted as head Medicine chief. They looked
on her with superstition, and reverenced her knowledge. In
faith, monsieur, she knows all that I do in the way of science
and art, and moreover, she is the head of all Indian woodcraft
and magic. But you can not turn her out of the way,
any more than the sun in heaven. She is immutable.”</p>

<p>Clark stood ruminating awhile over the priest’s words. At
last he answered:</p>

<p>“Father, give me your advice what to do.”</p>

<p>He detailed the history of his quarrel with the adjutant,
and concluded by saying:</p>

<p>“What less could I do, sir, than put under arrest the young
insolent, who insulted her and me alike? Is it just, sir, for
mademoiselle to visit this on me as a crime?”</p>

<p>Father Gibault took a pinch of snuff, and was silent.</p>

<p>“Why do you not answer, monsieur?” said Clark, pettishly.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le colonel,” said Gibault, dryly, “it is obvious
to me that your experience of women is limited. I never expect
from them such a cold and severe article as justice.”</p>

<p>“Then what am I to do, in heaven’s name, sir?” asked
the colonel, in a tone of desperation.</p>

<p>Gibault once more took snuff, and reflected a little.</p>

<p>“I think,” he said, at last, “that if I were you, (while I
am not, for I am a priest in orders, bound to celibacy) I
should take the hint the lady gave me, and—”</p>

<p>“Release the adjutant?” asked Clark, as the priest paused.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, <em>as a priest</em>, I can not give you any advice
which would tend toward uniting a good Catholic and yourself.”</p>

<p>And father Gibault gave the borderer a curious look, that
was compounded of sly humor and triumph.</p>

<p>Clark started back in amazement. So much was he engrossed
with what he thought mademoiselle’s injustice, that
he had not clearly understood whither he was tending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he said, stammeringly.</p>

<p>“I mean,” said the priest, quietly, “that every one in Kaskaskia,
except Colonel Clark, is fully aware that he has fallen
in love with Mademoiselle Roland, and that he is jealous
of a mere boy, because that boy is a favorite of mademoiselle’s.
Why, colonel, they are making songs about it in
the streets.”</p>

<p>Even as the priest spoke, they heard a chorus of lads in
the street, as the young rascals passed under the windows,
singing at the top of their voices a doggerel ditty, to the
old air of “Malbrook,” better known nowadays as “We
won’t go home till morning.” Clark listened, and turned red
and pale alternately, as he clutched his sword-hilt; for the
boys were coupling his own name with Ruby’s in the disrespectful
manner common to French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamin</i> and New York
“bhoy” alike.</p>

<p>For the benefit of our readers we append the song, with

</div></div></div></div>

<p>No English words can convey, however, the mocking accent
of the refrain in the chorus, and Clark was so much enraged
that he would have rushed out into the street, had
not father Gibault thrown himself into the way, crying:</p>

<p>“Hold, monsieur, in heaven’s name what are you about
to do? Consider, that you will make yourself ridiculous.
These people must sing, or they will plot.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>The colonel saw the folly of which he had nearly been
guilty, and restrained himself. A moment later, he saw
cause to congratulate himself, for, as he stood by the window,
looking down at the impudent boys, the old French
town constable made his appearance in the nick of time, and
promptly collared two of the young scamps.</p>

<p>“You see, monsieur,” said father Gibault, pointing, “you
did well to leave our old authorities in force. The old people
will not suffer you to be insulted. See old Antoine.
He knows hows to deal with the Kaskaskia boys.”</p>

<p>In effect, old Antoine seemed to be equal to the occasion,
for he was a very strong old man, and he knocked the heads
of the two boys together several times, with a force that made
them howl again, while the rest of the lately uproarious
group looked on, from afar off, in great dismay.</p>

<p>Clark, who had been standing by the open window, put
his hand in his pocket and pulled out a silver dollar, which
he threw down to the old constable, with a—</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, mon ami.</i>”</p>

<p>Old Antoine pulled off his hat, made a low bow, and
pocketed the coin with many genuflexions, while the border
leader turned away to Gibault, saying:</p>

<p>“My eyes are opened, father. The boys are right, after
all; but what shall I do about my adjutant? If it should
really happen that she loved him, I believe I should kill them
both.”</p>

<p>“How old is this adjutant?” inquired father Gibault, quietly.
“Remember, my son, that you lovers are apt to be jealous
about trifles, and that is foolish. How old is he?”</p>

<p>“A mere boy, not sixteen, and small for his age,” said
Clark, not without confusion. “But you must not fancy I am
jealous of <em>him</em>, father—a little whipper-snapper, whom I could
turn over my knee. No, sir; but you have no conception of
the insolence with which he referred to mademoiselle. It
was for that I placed him under arrest, and he kept talking
back, with a manner perfectly indescribable. By heavens, sir,
I wonder I did not kill him on the spot.”</p>

<p>Father Gibault smiled.</p>

<p>“I do not think you need be afraid of this boy, monsieur,
unless, indeed, you make a martyr of him. I would advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
you to follow mademoiselle’s hint, as a friend, not as a
priest.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, father,” said the Kentuckian, promptly. “Here,
orderly, go to the arsenal where the Indian chiefs lodge, and
say to Adjutant Frank, with my compliments, that I wish to
see him.”</p>

<p>The orderly left, and the commander paced up and down
the room impatiently, waiting for the arrival of the culprit
adjutant.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">MUTINY.</span></h2>


<p>In a short time after, the orderly rapped at the door, and
on being told to enter, announced:</p>

<p>“Please, colonel, the adjutant says as how he wants to
know ef he’s released from arrest?”</p>

<p>“Did he dare to ask you that?” inquired Clark, sharply;
and as he spoke his eye flashed.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, they wouldn’t let me see him,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Who wouldn’t let you see him?”</p>

<p>The commander was growing very angry, for he was a
strict disciplinarian, and this sounded terrible in his ears.</p>

<p>The orderly hesitated.</p>

<p>“Speak quick, man! <em>Who</em> wouldn’t let you see him?”</p>

<p>“Colonel,” said the rough borderer, who was, after all, only
a half disciplined, independent militia-man; “’tain’t my fault,
honest; but them Injuns and the young lady was at the door,
and the young lady she guv me the message from adjutant;
and please, colonel, the boys are all in a crowd around the
door, and they cheered her when she spoke, and it’s my belief,
sir—”</p>

<p>“That will do,” said Clark, imperiously. “I understand
you. There’s mutiny afoot, and you’re afraid. Out of the
way.”</p>

<p>Before father Gibault could interfere to check him, the
colonel was out of the room and half-way down-stairs. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
was in a state of the greatest excitement, and shouted for his
horse in a manner strangely unlike his usual quiet way. Two
minutes after, he was galloping down the street toward the
camp, which, as before, was pitched in front of the disused
arsenal occupied by the Indians.</p>

<p>Around the door, as the orderly had said, the whole of the
motley force of borderers were clustered; and from the murmurs
that reached his ear, it was evident that an unusual excitement
was going on.</p>

<p>As the colonel galloped up, a dead silence fell on all; but
not a man stirred out of his way, and matters looked quite
squally, for the rough backwoodsmen made no scruple of looking
with open defiance at their leader.</p>

<p>The tact of Clark was infinite, or he would not have been
the successful leader that he was. He saw now that he had
made a mistake, and pulled up his horse by the crowd, saying,
quietly:</p>

<p>“Stand out of my way, men. I want to enter that building.”</p>

<p>He looked at the door of the arsenal, and there stood beautiful
Ruby Roland, with her savage allies round her, stern and
impassive, looking straight at him.</p>

<p>Not a man stirred out of his path. Some of them crowded
closer in his way, and he saw that they all carried their rifles.
For the first time in his life, Clark was at a loss what to do.
The instinct of discipline impelled him to violence, but his
experience of the reckless Kentuckians told him that such a
step would be useless.</p>

<p>Moreover, Bowman and all his officers stood in a group at
a fire near by, with their backs resolutely turned to the scene
of disturbance. Clark was too intensely proud to call for assistance
from them which he saw they were unwilling to
grant. He was also too politic to precipitate a fight by attempting
to ride into the crowd.</p>

<p>For fully a minute an ominous silence prevailed, and then
Clark spoke to Ruby, in a clear, loud voice:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, is my adjutant in your quarters? If so, I
call on you, as my ally, to deliver him up to me.”</p>

<p>Like a silver trumpet came back Ruby’s answer.</p>

<p>“He is here. He shall not go forth till he is released
from arrest, except to be tried by a court-martial.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly a tremendous cheer burst from all the borderers,
and Clark saw that he had not a friend left.</p>

<p>It was a bitter and humiliating thing for the proud leader,
in the moment of his triumph over enemies; and Clark felt it
keenly.</p>

<p>For one moment he looked reproachfully at Ruby, then on
his rebellious men. There was something in his face that
abashed the boldest there, for the anger had gone out of it
entirely, and there was an expression of proud regret that
seemed for the first time to suggest that there might be <em>two</em>
sides to this question. Then the border leader put his hands
to his holsters, drew forth his pistols, and cast them on the
ground, amid a dead silence. He unbuckled his sword and
held it up in his right hand, as he said:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, I see now who is my <em>real</em> enemy. God
forgive you. Men, I never yet condescended to ask a favor
of you. I have given you a new country. Keep it for yourselves.
I am no longer your leader.”</p>

<p>He threw down the sword as he spoke, and wheeled his
horse. Slowly and sadly, but with head proudly erect, he
rode up the street to the government house, passed it, and
walked his horse through the principal street out into the
open prairie.</p>

<p>The men had conquered their commander.</p>

<p>But never in this world did men seem so utterly unable to
take advantage of a victory. They looked at each other in
silence and dismay, as the consequences of their acts dawned
upon them. Never was leader more beloved than Clark, and
only the still greater affection which they entertained for their
little adjutant, and their impression that he had been harshly
treated by Clark, had induced them to rebel. In that delicious
ignorance of martial law, so characteristic of the American
border militiamen, they had never conceived that they were
doing any thing wrong; only that they were giving their
colonel a gentle hint to release their favorite officer. Now,
when it was too late, they all seemed bewildered, and none
more so than Ruby Roland. She stood at the top of the
steps, gazing blankly after Clark, as if unable to comprehend
why he had not yielded.</p>

<p>Then, after the form of the colonel had gone almost out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
sight, arose a confused hubbub of voices, as the borderers broke
up into groups, and excitedly discussed the position.</p>

<p>As reverently as sacred relics, the weapons of their commander
were lifted from the ground, and a large deputation
besieged Major Bowman and the officers, to entreat the colonel
to come back.</p>

<p>But to their great surprise, Bowman and the others were
dead against them. The fact was that every one saw that
they had made a mistake, and these very officers were mean
enough to cast the blame off from their own shoulders, no
matter where it lighted. Major Bowman was, in fact, the
very meanest of all, for he threw off his sword and belt,
saying:</p>

<p>“No, no, boys. I take no responsibility. You chose to
listen to that gal over yonder, and now she’ll have to get you
out of the snarl. I’ve naught to do with it. I told you not
to make such a fuss about that boy; that it would end in
harm. I’ll take no command of a mob like this. Go to your
lady friend.”</p>

<p>And Big Bill Harrod was still more emphatic.</p>

<p>“I tell yer, boys, that Frank’s the sassiest little cuss ever I
seen, and a good whipping would do him good. Ef yer think
he’s wuth more than cunnel, let him go; but ef yer don’t,
jest yer go over to that thur young lady, and ax <em>her</em> to go arter
the cunnel, and tell him as how ye made a mistake, and
ax his pardon. I guess he won’t be hard on little Frank, ef
<em>she</em> begs fur him, and it’s my notion that nary a man in this
hyar camp kin fotch him back so quick as that thar gal.”</p>

<p>The rough captain’s words were not without their effect on
his audience, who involuntarily turned toward Ruby.</p>

<p>The girl was standing where she had been, but entirely deserted
by the very men who, a moment before, had been cheering
her. She seemed to realize that her brief reign of popularity
was over, and that she too had made a mistake. As the
soldiers timidly proffered their request, the august beauty
yielded to it with grace, mounted her horse without a moment’s
delay, and set off at full gallop after Clark, bearing the
commander’s sword with her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">RUBY’S MISSION.</span></h2>


<p>Colonel Clark had already cleared the outskirts of the
town, and was alone in the wild prairie, a swell of land hiding
him from view. He rode slowly along, buried in painful and
bitter thoughts. He began to see that he had been hasty in
his first explosion of anger against the adjutant. Had it been
possible to have recalled it, he would have done so; but now
that mutiny had boldly established itself, he felt that he must
be firm, right or wrong. His resignation of authority, though
it seemed as if wrung from him in desperation, was in
reality nothing but a return of his old tact and management.</p>

<p>That the movement had taken his men by surprise he felt
sure from the dead silence which followed his words. He
fully expected that a message would come after him, but he
expected it from his officers, at whom he felt very angry for
not having given him their support.</p>

<p>He had resolved to coquette with them before he yielded,
as he had all along determined, and resumed the command.
He was resolved to make them realize his full value. When
he heard the clatter of horsehoofs behind him, therefore, he
kept steadily on. The fact that only a single person was following
him somewhat surprised him, but he did not deign to
turn his head.</p>

<p>Then some one dashed past him at full speed, and Ruby
Roland, in all her splendor of beauty, wheeled around in front
of his horse and halted, extending the sheathed sword with
an imperious gesture.</p>

<p>Clark was for a moment taken aback. The next he colored
angrily and waved her aside, saying:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, it is too late. You have your victory. See
if you can make as good use of it as I have. Permit me to
pass.”</p>

<p>“I will not,” said Ruby, firmly. “You must resume your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
command, sir. There are too many lives depending on you
to be lost for a foolish quarrel about a girl.”</p>

<p>“Did you think of that, mademoiselle,” he asked, bitterly,
“when you undertook to excite my men to mutiny, to protect
an insolent boy, who called you—. No, I will not say what.
No, mademoiselle, but I will say this, that it is a hard thing
to find that when I did a thing to avenge <em>your</em> name from insult,
<em>you</em> should be the first person to protect my enemy, and
steal away my men’s hearts from the leader they trusted till
<em>you</em> came between us.”</p>

<p>Ruby listened to his indignant words in silence. The girl
was very pale now, and her eyes had a strange light in them,
as of triumph and revenge, which struck the colonel as singular,
when he met them.</p>

<p>“So the little girl you despised last year, and packed off
to her tribe, is not so powerless, after all, monsieur?” she
said, in a low tone. “She has stirred your proud heart at
last.”</p>

<p>“If it is any consolation to you to know it,” said Clark,
bitterly, “you know my heart as well as I do. Perhaps you
and your boy lover have laughed over my endeavors to save
your name from light speaking.”</p>

<p>“Who asked you to save my name from any thing?” said
she, haughtily. “You take on yourself an impertinence to
do it. Did I ask you to fire up like a fool before those rude
fellows, and show your heart so plainly that the boys in the
streets sing lampoons about us? Who is to blame for that,
sir, but you? My name, indeed! Much you have cared for
it to permit it to be dragged through the mud of Kaskaskia,
because <em>you</em> have a temper that you can not control. I am a
fool to come here to entreat you to come back. Would I
had never seen you! Let the sword lie where you have
dashed my name, since you are no longer fit to wear it.”</p>

<p>And the excited girl indignantly dashed the sword on the
ground, and wheeled her horse to ride away. Then it was
that Clark put spurs to his own horse and darted forward,
laying his hand on her bridle with iron grasp.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, mademoiselle,” he said, sternly. “You have
cast an imputation on my honor that I can not visit on you,
but, by heavens, I will visit it on <em>him</em>. Do you understand?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
I see it all now. You love this boy; and now I warn you
that you shall never be his, nor any other man’s but mine.
Do you hear? I will resume command of my troops, and my
first act shall be to release your lover from arrest. For
what will follow, you alone are responsible. I have
done.”</p>

<p>He let go the bridle, quietly dismounted from his horse,
and picked up his sword, then mounted and turned toward
the town at the same slow pace at which he had
come.</p>

<p>Ruby sat gazing at him for a moment with a strange smile;
it almost seemed tender and compassionate, and yet it was
decidedly triumphant.</p>

<p>“I have him safe,” she said, to herself.</p>

<p>Then she dashed away past him at the utmost speed of
her mustang, swept through the streets like a whirlwind,
and drew up in front of the camp, where every one was
still clustered in groups. Ruby rode straight up to the
officers.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, gentlemen?” she cried. “You have
allowed the greatest General in this country to be insulted by
his own troops, whom he has led to victory; and when he
resigns in disgust, not one of you is fit to step into his shoes;
and yet you have left it to a woman to entreat him to come
back. For shame, old women that you are! Do one thing or
another. Choose another chief, or welcome back your old
one. Beat the drums; fall in the men! Send a deputation
to request him to resume command. Act like soldiers, not
like boys!”</p>

<p>Her fiery eloquence seemed to go like a shock through the
crowd. As if by magic the drummer struck up “To the Colors;”
the men rushed to their places; Bowman and Harrod
mounted and rode off up the street to salute the returning
commander.</p>

<p>The parade of Clark’s Rangers had never been formed before
with one-half the celerity that was manifested on this occasion;
and when Clark, soon after, rode up to the center of
the line, the order was perfect, and every one in his
place.</p>

<p>As for Ruby, she was nowhere to be seen. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the parade was formed, she rode straight up the steps of the
arsenal, received by her dusky escort with the same impassive
silence that they had manifested all through the proceedings.</p>

<p>The great gray building was now closed up, silent and grim
as ever, and to all appearance untenanted.</p>

<p>When the commander appeared, there was a dead silence.
He had not greeted either Bowman or Harrod, except by
stiffly answering their salute, and now the two officers repaired
to their places in the line of battle.</p>

<p>Then the acting-adjutant gave the order “present arms!”
and turned over the parade to his commander in due form.
Clark drew his sword once more, and rode forward to near
the center of the line. His face was particularly grim at the
moment, and the silence was breathless.</p>

<p>“The acting-adjutant will take a sergeant and twelve men,”
said Clark, in a clear, hard tone, “from the right of the regiment.
He will enter that building, and bring forth Adjutant
John Frank, now under arrest, under guard, and report
to me, here.”</p>

<p>In dead silence the order was obeyed.</p>

<p>The little adjutant himself, in full uniform, with a snowy
peruke covering his black locks, trim and dainty, in a laced
suit of blue and silver, made his appearance in the doorway,
bowed politely to the officer, and advanced into the middle of
his guards, as if by a previous understanding.</p>

<p>Then he was marched up to the colonel, who dismissed
guard and acting-adjutant alike to their places, with a sign,
when colonel and adjutant stood looking at each other. The
little officer was quiet, dignified, and serious, without a particle
of the old sauciness. He looked his commander full in
the face without blenching, and Clark said, in a very distinct
tone:</p>

<p>“Sir, you are relieved from arrest. Take your post at parade.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE COUNCIL OF WAR.</span></h2>


<p>The silence that had so far been maintained was broken
by a rapturous cheer, which the rough frontiersmen could not
suppress.</p>

<p>Its tones were by no means offensive to Clark. They spoke
of gratitude to him, not of triumph over him.</p>

<p>The adjutant drew his sword and retired to his post behind
his commanding officer, while the latter executed a few
simple movements and then returned his sword. The adjutant
resumed his regular duties, took the reports of the sergeants
in due form, announced the dismissal of parade, and
came up with the officers in the stiff military form that has
descended to the present day.</p>

<p>At such a time, it is usual for the colonel to say a few
words to his officers, and after such a scene as had recently
taken place, all expected a severe lecture from Clark.</p>

<p>But he merely returned their silent salute, and said:</p>

<p>“Officers will meet at my quarters an hour after sunset, to
discuss matters of importance. Good-evening, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>He turned coldly away, and the parade broke up in silence,
a wet blanket being thrown over all parties by the distant demeanor
of their commander.</p>

<p>The little adjutant alone seemed to be quite happy over
his release. When Clark was not twenty feet off, and the
officers were still gloomily looking at each other, the boy
spoke in a jesting tone to Harrod, saying:</p>

<p>“Well, Captain Bill, you see we pulled through in spite of
our love-sick chief. What fools some men are!”</p>

<p>Harrod cast a curious glance at the boy, an apprehensive
one at Clark. The colonel heard every word, and—halted.</p>

<p>Frank stood, with a derisive smile on a very pale face,
watching his commander’s back.</p>

<p>But Clark did not deign to turn his head. He stood there,
for nearly a minute, like a statue, the officers watching him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in silence. Then he slowly nodded his head, and pursued his
way to his quarters.</p>

<p>Then the officers broke up and departed, leaving the boy
adjutant standing alone. His face grew sad and thoughtful,
for not one of the men who had lately fought such a battle
to save him, remained near him. Even from the ranks they
had witnessed the flippant gesture with which he had pointed
at his commander; and every one seemed to be somewhat
disgusted with him for the nonce.</p>

<p>With slow steps and hanging head the young officer went
to his quarters in the arsenal once more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the spacious drawing-room of the government house sat
Clark, in a new uniform, surrounded by his officers, all renovated
in their personal appearance. A number of wax candles
lit up the apartment, and the center-table was littered
with papers. Father Gibault sat among the rest of the officers
as if he had been a chaplain all his life, and the conversation
was general but desultory, as if in expectation of the
arrival of some one before opening business.</p>

<p>At last the commander spoke:</p>

<p>“We are all here but the adjutant, gentlemen. Doubtless
he feels a delicacy about being present. Orderly, take my
compliments to the adjutant, and say that we await his presence.”</p>

<p>The soldier disappeared, and all sat in grim silence until,
fifteen minutes after, the door opened, and the little adjutant
tripped into the room with his old saucy air, but without
speaking, and, after saluting the colonel, dropped into a vacant
chair:</p>

<p>Clark returned the salute with grave courtesy, and said:</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, we are ready for business. I must inform
you, first, that I have at last concluded a full and satisfactory
treaty with all the Indians on the Wabash, through
their chiefs, and that, from the Detroit to the Ohio we have
no foes among the red-men. We have taken possession of
all the British posts between here and the Wabash, and Illinois
is ours. Gentlemen, one post remains to be taken. St.
Vincent’s, town and fort, is still in the enemy’s hands. <em>It
must be taken.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>A murmur of assent ran through the audience, and Clark
was silent. Then, to the surprise of all, father Gibault arose:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</i>, “I have told Colonel Clark,
and now I tell you, that you need not trouble yourselves about
St. Vincent’s. If you will trust it to me, I will undertake to
start to-morrow, and within three weeks deliver St. Vincent’s
into your hands, fort and all, without spilling one drop of
blood. I am priest or missionary of both parishes, and if I
tell the people of St. Vincent’s how you have treated us here,
I answer for it that they will come under American rule
without firing a gun.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, how say you?” said Clark. “Will you accept
Monsieur Gibault’s proposition, or shall we march to St.
Vincent’s? All in favor of acceptance will say ‘Ay.’”</p>

<p>Not an officer hesitated to respond to the call in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Now, messieurs,” said Gibault, briskly, “I start to-morrow,
with four or five friends, and I wish the colonel to give
me one officer to receive the surrender and act as American
Governor till you can visit the post in force.”</p>

<p>“Captain Leonard Helm and Sergeant Henry will accompany
you, father,” said the border chief, “and Adjutant Frank
shall go with the captain as second in command.”</p>

<p>This order surprised no one, for it was evident that colonel
and adjutant would never agree together again. Indeed,
Clark’s intention was of the kindest nature. But as the
council broke up, the young officer observed, in a loud tone:</p>

<p>“I shall not go. So the colonel need not trouble himself.”</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">THE DISCOVERY.</span></h2>


<p>At this last exhibition of insubordination, every one fancied
that the commander’s temper would once more break out.
But, to the surprise of all, Clark remained quite calm, and
took no notice of it. He ushered his other officers to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
door with his usual courtesy, and attended them to the head
of the stairs, whence he watched them go out with father
Gibault.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the sentry at the door, and said:</p>

<p>“Move your post to the head of the stairs, and let no one
up. If you hear any noise in my room, however loud, take
no notice. Let no one pass in or out without my orders.”</p>

<p>The backwoods soldier nodded his comprehension, and the
colonel re-entered his room, where, as he had expected, he
found Adjutant Frank, still in his chair, which he had drawn
to the table, on which rested his small feet with all the coolness
in the world.</p>

<p>The little adjutant wore a hunting-shirt of fine blue cloth,
with gold fringes to replace the usual buck-skin ornaments;
his leggins were of white doe-skin, fringed with gold; and
the white moccasin, that fitted his little foot like a glove, was
sewed with gold thread. Altogether, a very natty little officer
of rangers was Adjutant Frank, as he sat playing with a little
blue velvet cap with a gold tassel, and whistling “Malbrook.”</p>

<p>Clark stood at the door, looking at him for several minutes.
The lad’s back was turned to him, and the white peruke,
which he generally wore, was now off, allowing the curls of
a wonderful mass of long black hair to escape over his shoulders.</p>

<p>Clark looked at him long and earnestly, and as he looked,
he gave an involuntary sigh. The boy was of a wonderful
beauty and grace, he could not help admitting, even with all
the fierce jealousy and anger that was gnawing at his heart.
But the iron colonel had taken a resolution, and he was not
to be turned from it by pity.</p>

<p>Slowly, and without any precautions against noise, he
locked the door with a loud snap, and put the key in his
pocket. Frank stopped whistling, but he did not look round.
He only gave a little hitch to his sword-belt, and brought the
hilt of his light rapier to the front. Then he resumed his
whistle and gradually broke into a low song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Le Colonel Clark est brave,
</div><div class="indent0">Mais il n’est qu’ un esclave,
</div><div class="indent0">Sous la main, si douce et suave,
</div><div class="indent0">De Mademoiselle Rubie Roland.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Clark heard the mocking words and wondered at the lad’s
temerity, even while his anger rose to white heat. Frank
looked so little and slender, so utterly unable to cope with
the powerful and incensed colonel, that such a taunt as his
conduct implied made it seem as if he must be crazy.</p>

<p>For the first time the words of Simon Kenton, as to the
boy having been sun-struck, recurred to his mind, and for the
moment a thrill of pity came to Clark. But as he looked at
the boy and noted the quiet bravado of his manner, the supposition
became untenable.</p>

<p>“There is too much method for madness, there,” thought
the border leader.</p>

<p>And, as he came to this conclusion, a stern frown settled
on his brow, and he went to the windows. He carefully
closed the shutters and locked the French casements so that
no one could see in. Then, looking into an inner room, he
ascertained that there were no more openings to be guarded.</p>

<p>He closed and locked the door of communication with
equal deliberation, then advanced to the table at which Frank
sat, and laid his hand heavily on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said Clark, between his shut teeth, “what is
the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>The lad looked up at him with an eye as fierce as his own.</p>

<p>“It means—take your hands off!”</p>

<p>For all answer Clark shook him fiercely, for it seemed as
if the threat imbued him with ten-fold rage.</p>

<p>But, to his surprise, after the first fierce look, the boy did
not either writhe or struggle, although the nervous grip of
the powerful borderer must have caused intense pain, as the
fingers sunk into his shoulder.</p>

<p>Feeling almost ashamed of himself, Clark released his hold,
for the first feeling of the soft, delicate shoulder he had
griped had convinced him that Frank was a mere child in
his hands. He struck down the boy’s feet off the table with
his open hand, and then released him, casting himself down
in an opposite chair.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” he said, sternly, “since you have learned your
manners, tell me what is the meaning of all this?”</p>

<p>The little adjutant was quite silent, but he was breathing
hard, and had changed his position. His face was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
turned away from Clark and hidden by the tangled mass of
curls. He made no answer.</p>

<p>After a while Clark repeated the question.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, what does this mean? Why have you, whom
I have treated like my own son, suddenly found that nothing
will do for you but insulting your colonel and exciting mutiny
among my troops?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Still the averted figure looked sullenly
away.</p>

<p>“I see you can not answer,” said Clark, sternly; “and I
honor the shame that leads you to remain silent. It shows me
that Governor Henry’s nephew has not lost all the instincts of
a gentleman. It renders my task less repulsive, for I warn
you, John Frank, that the time has come when you must atone
for your conduct with your heart’s blood—ay, and in this
room. Had you shown fear, I should have strangled you
ere this, but I can not take advantage of superior strength
over a stripling like you. But die you must, and by my hand.
Therefore, choose your weapons, and do your best. You
shall have every chance.”</p>

<p>The boy still kept his head averted, and murmured:</p>

<p>“Why should I die? What have I done?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you, John Frank,” said the colonel, in a low,
stern voice, with terrible distinctness. “I will tell you, and
you at least shall know all before I kill you. A year ago, I
met Ruby Roland in Kentucky, and from the moment I saw
her I resolved she should be my wife. You may start. I
would sooner die than tell her, the proud beauty in her scornful
charms, that George Rogers Clark was a slave to her a
year since. I would not tell it to you if I had not resolved
to kill you, before I leave this room. Well, sir, since you
came here—curse your pretty baby-face—I have met <em>her</em>, and
I have found that she loves <em>you</em>; she, the pearl of all beauty
and nobility, is fool enough to cast away the treasures of a
love, which I would die to possess, on an insolent youngster
like you, who values it not, and makes a jest of her name.
For these things I am going to kill you, boy, and just so I
shall kill every man that comes near Ruby Roland. She may
never love me, but, by the eternal heavens, I swear she shall
never love another. She may repel my love, but I will conquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
hers. I have sworn to make her adore me. Enough.
On this table are two swords and two pistols. Choose which
you will, and take first shot.”</p>

<p>The averted figure trembled perceptibly.</p>

<p>“I do not want to kill you, colonel,” said a low voice.</p>

<p>“Nor can you,” said Clark, scornfully. “I was not born
to be killed by a boy. Take your shot, and aim well, for if
you miss I kill you.”</p>

<p>The little adjutant trembled still more.</p>

<p>“I can not fight you, Clark,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“But you must,” cried the borderer, fiercely. “Do you
wish to compel me to murder you? You must die.”</p>

<p>The other rose from the chair and sprung behind the table.
As he did so, he motioned Clark away, with face averted, as
if in great horror.</p>

<p>“Clark, Clark,” he panted out, “you know not what you
say. I can not fight <em>you</em>. If you kill me, you will never see
Ruby Roland again.”</p>

<p>“I will chance that,” said Clark, grimly. “She may grieve
for you a while, but bah! she’ll not care for a boy like you,
when a man loves her. And mark me, boy, she loves me now,
although she does not think it. Come, take up the swords.
I thought you had more courage, Frank. I see you are only
a coward, after all.”</p>

<p>The boy dropped his head on his hands so that his long
black hair fell all over his face and hid it from view. Then
he sunk down on his knees and burst out into a tempest of
sobs, while he murmured, brokenly:</p>

<p>“Kill me, then—blind, blind, that will not see the truth.
Would I had died long ago!”</p>

<p>For the first time Clark was utterly astounded. He looked
at the kneeling figure, shaken with sobs such as no boy ever
gave, and as he looked a sudden light broke over his face.
He looked at the other with a keen intensity of gaze that, for
the first time since he had known his boy adjutant, took in
every peculiarity of the slight, feminine grace of that tiny
figure. Then, with a sudden exclamation of joy, wonder and
doubt together, Colonel Clark rushed forward and clutched
eagerly at the form of <span class="smcap">Ruby Roland</span>.</p>

<p>Ay, the moment he felt the soft, yielding flesh under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
hands this time, he wondered that he had never found it out
before. His little adjutant, with the pert tongue, and Ruby
Roland whom he adored, were one and the same, a warm,
living woman, who hid her face under her dark hair in his
bosom, and refused to lift it, even for a glimpse of her face, until
he forced her up from her knees, with gentle violence.</p>

<p>Then she suddenly flung away from him with all her old
impetuosity and caprice, threw back her long black hair with
a defiant toss, facing him with glowing face and flaming eyes,
and caught up a sword from the table.</p>

<p>“Now, sir, kill me if you dare,” she cried. “You were
bold enough with Frank. Let me see you face Ruby. Go
away. I hate you now!”</p>

<p>Clark laughed carelessly as he advanced.</p>

<p>“You must explain away your masquerade, and a hundred
other little things I mind me of, lady-bird, ere you can make
me believe that. If you do not love me, what do you here
with me, alone, at midnight?”</p>

<p>In a moment she was pale and beseeching.</p>

<p>“Let me go, Clark, and I’ll never tease you again.”</p>

<p>“Not till you have promised to marry me to-morrow, ere
father Gibault departs.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” she whispered, and he unlocked the door.</p>



<hr class="chap">

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br>
<span class="cheaderfont">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>


<p>The month of July had passed and gone, and yet Ruby
had not yet kept her promise to Clark. The reason partly
was that father Gibault had already gone before the American
commandant could inform him of the nature of his discovery,
and of the need of his services, partly because Ruby
herself begged off with unwonted humility, till father Gibault
returned from St. Vincent’s.</p>

<p>In the meantime the awakened lovers passed many a pleasant
hour together, and explained away many a mystery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the past. Then first Ruby learned that the apparent coldness
with which Clark had treated her at Harrodsburg was put
on only to hide the real interest he had felt in her from the
first. Then, too, the colonel learned how Ruby’s mother was
a niece of one of the Henry family, and how she had first
obtained the letter which had introduced her under the name
of John Frank. He learned also how the interest between
them had been mutual, but hightened by pique on the part of
Ruby at his supposed indifference. He learned how she had
followed him to Kaskaskia, keeping in constant communication
with her father’s warriors all the way, resolved to succor
him if need should be. When she saw what an impression
she had produced on him with her beauty in full dress, then
it was that for the first time she resolved to try and see if he
really loved her. Assisted by her Indian confederates, she
had paraded about a dummy figure dressed in the adjutant’s
uniform, so as to disarm any suspicion that might arise that
Ruby and the little officer were one and the same person;
and then, after exhibiting herself on several occasions at full
speed, along with the dummy figure, on horseback, she
dropped the pretense and boldly enacted either character at
will.</p>

<p>At last August came in, and with it father Gibault. The
old priest had been completely successful in his mission to
St. Vincent’s. The French inhabitants, heartily sick of their
English rulers, no sooner heard the priest’s news than they
met in a body at their church, took the oath of allegiance to
America in the most solemn manner, hoisted the American
flag in their empty fort, and elected Helm their commandant.
Thus was the last fruit of harvest saved without plucking,
and the conquest of Illinois finished.</p>

<p>It was not many days after that Adjutant Frank disappeared
to be seen no more. His chief said he had returned
to Kentucky, but the men were all sorry to miss him. On
the same day Captain Joseph Montgomery took Governor
Rocheblave a prisoner to Richmond, and all the bells of Kaskaskia
rung a joyful peal to celebrate the union of the border
leader with his beautiful bride, <span class="smcap">Ruby Roland</span>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
